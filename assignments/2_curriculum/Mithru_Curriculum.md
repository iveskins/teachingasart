#Mithru's Dream Curriculum


Before I write about my dream curriculum, I wanted to write about my actual experience in tenth grade. We had the following subjects - English, Hindi, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History and Geography. Computer Science was also a subject but was not considered for the final exams. The only thing that mattered was if we were able to reproduce definitions from the book word to word with no errors. It was a daunting process, and we were all made to believe that the year's checkpoint exam would decide the fate of our lives. Most of us shed tears, many of us would have disturbed sleep (years later) as a result of nightmares of failing these exams. 

At the end, we remembered little of what we learnt, and all that was just for this piece of paper that was never used ever again in any real world situation.

If I was to go back and redesign it, this is what I would do:

**Objectives**

* To engage students in real world problems using a semi-fictional medium.
* To encourage teamwork through exploration of this semi-fictional medium
* To gamify the learning of real-world concepts in science. 
* To apply the learnt concepts in the real world
* To eventually explore the real world

**Process**

The students will explore a semi-fictional India through a multiplayer role playing game. The game, despite being multiplayer, will have no easy means of communication with other players (no chat, or voice calls). However, the only way to progress through the open-ended game is through teamwork. The students will have to talk to each other in the real world about challenges in the virtual world in order to solve them. They may however figure out and invent their own means of communication within the world. The game will  feature real-world live problems across different regions of the map which they have to solve collectively. The teacher decides the outcome of their results, and may impose a new set of problems that are consequential to their collective choices.

The students will also have to prove sufficient proficiency with their personal characters in individual quests as well. Students will have to learn real world science in order to apply it in the virtual world in order to progress through the game, essentially building a skill-tree as they go. The game will ensure that the basic needed knowledge of all subjects will be covered in order to expose the student to the many possible paths and their interconnectedness. Ofcourse, if students find themselves struggling in a certain area, they may help each other, and even request extra help from the teachers.

The game will feature an economy that are subject to real world changes as well as choices of the class. The students will be expected to handle their personal and societal treasuries, and avoid economic hurdles. 

Real world field trips will be planned according to the events of the game, where students will try to apply their ideas that they simulated in the virtual world. 

External existential threats may also be included to attempt to force the entire cohort to set aside differences and act as one. 

The entire objective of the game is to leave the virtual world in a better state than was received to them. The following year's students will then take over the year. The idea is to encourage students to talk to their seniors and juniors as well.
