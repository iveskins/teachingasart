##a very brief history of my actual 10th grade curriculum

"Students must take English, History, Mathematics, Science, Judaic Studies, World Language, and a Fine Arts or Physical Education elective course each semester."

##teaching philosophy
people already know a lot. they are capable of learning without being forced. what matters is that the search for knowledge be framed within the following facts: 
- our continued existence depends on the well-being of other people and creatures that we share neighborhoods, cities, countries, airports, air space, bytes with
- what is a country anyway?
- the resources we depend on are exhaustible and must be stewarded
- everything comes from somewhere and is made by someone
- no one is illegal or disposable
- trash does not go away; there is no "away"
- you can probably make your own

##learning objective
over the course of the semester, students will be exposed to methods for pursuing and synthesizing knowledge. they will also be exposed to the stories of people who did this themselves in the fields of math, science, and art. we'll spend time with those people's work and try to find traces of their thinking in the physical and theoretical stuff they made. 

to continue building on past historical knowledge of how we came to be where we are as americans, we will continue looking at primary records of indigenous people and slaves.

##learning outcome
students will learn how to find resources to support the learning they want to do in the format that best complements their work. to figure out what formats work well for them, they will produce a series of projects over the course of the semester.

- students will build a system or object that supports the learning of someone they know.
- students will write a paper synthesizing ideas they were exposed to and using that synthesis to suggest a next line of inquiry.
- students will conduct new research in a methodologically rigorous and reproducible way and report their findings.
