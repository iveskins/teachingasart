## Background

My sophomore year in high school was boring and alienating. I moved schools from a large public high school in suburb to a larger public high school closer to Cerritos, Los Angeles. The school shared the campus and classes with another school, focusing on the fine arts and performing arts. It was impossible for me to connect to someone there, mostly because of my awkwardness and partly because of the curriculum and school structure. I was struggling academically as well. Moving from one school to another where the curriculums weren’t aligned, I was ill prepared for some classes. Also, I was seperated from my family (by choice) and lived with two other teenagers without a guardian. Two years of relatively under-parented period in my youth, I lived a relatively uneventful but unstructured life. Democracy among teenagers is not easy. It takes more work, care and diplomacy. Also, I missed a sense of community, I fely difficilty of finding a community among such as big groups and cliques in school, as an immigrantion and as a stranger. I moved to another school in my junior year. There are many things I wish I've learned in these years. If I had a chance to learning about some of the ideas in the following curriculum, I couldn've prevented myself from making terrible mistakes that can't be undone. Everything is learning, but sometimes learning can be painful and last a logn time. The student inherits many bias from the society. It takes years of loving care and education to unlearn such things. This curriculum is designed to empower students for independence, while protecting them from certain common problems.

- Not focusing on specific subject matter, but topics of shared interest. Student learns about the topic through various disciplines. (Pro/Con)  
- Social justice, local activism leads to empowerment  
- Sex and sexuality
- We need to learn about racism, sexism, ableism and elitism. because in much of our life, we learn these unconsciously and we need to unlearn after learning. 
- I think working at a paying job is very important. It teaches the difficulty of labor and financial responsibility, and prepares students for independence. 
- I’m a fan of structure for the sake of dismantling, or questioning the structure. Unstructured curriculum leaves too much burden and uncertainty for the student.  
- Publishing facility: exhibition and employment opportunity leads to encouragement.

- Sex to Love: It’s the fundamental aspect of being a living being, being alive. The medical treatment of sexuality displaces the real life experience with more fictional cases and augment students ideas about love and desire.  
- In the 10th grade, sexual desire is the largest driving force for doing anything.   
- The idea of consent and respect, safety and love of sex  
 
 In a sense, we are learning to become more human, to identify and exercise our capabilities. Education is not extending one's abilities, but transforming one's learning webs toward independence.
