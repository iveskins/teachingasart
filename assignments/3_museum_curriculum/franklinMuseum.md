For this week’s assignment, I went to Guggenheim, I was there for the Tales of Our time. The exhibition is something I felt I shouldn’t miss but I have procrastinated for a long time.

I particularly drawn attention to “Can’t Help Myself”. It features An enormous robotic arm, brandishing a giant squeegee, is poised over a pool of dark liquid which ceaselessly oozes outwards. With quick, smooth, aggressive movements, the machine performs a calculated dance, pivoting and dragging its squeegee across the surface in a perpetual labor of wiping the liquid back to the center.

The viscous red liquid reminds me of anything that is human related, and being “managed” by the robotic arm causes me to have a complex feeling of both pleasure and panic of the world that is heavily involved with technology. The artist points out that  Only in the accidents of a computer glitch, a power failure or losing a cellphone can we realize that we are kidnapped by today’s knowledge structure. The stronger such sense of dependence feels, the stronger the feelings of panic and pleasure it brings. The most frightening part is that no matter how we reflect on it, it cannot be stopped… At the same time fears are exciting, for the knowledge beyond our experience is coming.

Therefore, as technology becomes increasingly present in our lives, this anxiety over the dynamics of human/machine relationships becomes more and more normal to us. But even if machines develop a new calculating capacity that exceeds their original settings, those calculations will still be based on the logic programmed by humans. So maybe instead we can rely on those machines as our agent, they can help us to carry out the will.

Guggenheim has this really amazing education program called Teaching through Art, and as I browsed around the curriculum that they offer various topics or maybe strategies of arts, such as games, abstraction, symbolic materials and etc. From what I have been narrating above, I believe I can open up a new workshop as a part of many of those curriculums - Machines as your agent.

***Machines as Your Agent***

**Audience:** High school/college/graduate students & adults, with interests in arts, technology and its relationship to human.

**Content:**  We will go through a brief of contemprory arts that involved technology, and analyze those artists’ use of technology and their strategies.  After the brief we will have a little studio seesion that allows the participants to examine their usage of technology with provided tools (perhaps robotic arms, simple programs and etc) as an agent to carry out their will in an artistic way.

**Learning objectives:** We will figure out why technology and how it can be a better medium for you to express maybe on certain subjects.

**Time:** 2 hours in total. 1 hour for the brief and 1 hour for the studio session.

**Location:** Guggenheim Museum.
