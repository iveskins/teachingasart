##The Visit

I visited the New Museum for this assignment.

On their site there was a section highlighting what they call a "Resource Center". It seems to be in the same ethos as our class:

"Located on the Fifth Floor of the Museum, the Resource Center is a hybrid exhibition, study, and pedagogical space that provides a generative platform for presenting histories, in-depth research, and broader contexts for artistic and curatorial production. Overseen by the Department of Education and Public Engagement, the flexible space is programmed by a variety of practitioners: in some cases, shows are organized by Museum staff around the New Museumâ€™s own historical documents; in others, it is occupied by artists, curators, educators, scholars, et al., who bring archival materials or projects from elsewhere. Materials examined range from archival documents, artworks, and other physical materials alongside presentations of digital content, such as video recordings of performance and discursive programs or film and video artworks."

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, and when I came in and asked about it, the person at the ticket counter said, "It might not be what you expect."

It seems that the space will be linked with whoever is in residence on that floor at the time. Currently that artist is A.K. Burns.

It turns out that while still being a pedagogical space, it was definitely serving as an extension of the installation as well. The Resource Center has been thematically curated to match the topics of the female body and expression of anger via primal urges to scream and punch. In certain ways it was a respite from the rest of the museum, which was very crowded, and ironically calming given the subject matter. And despite being a kind of "extra" installation piece (see the punching bag in the middle of the room), you could see actual offices linked adjacently and in the corner was a book shelf that appeared to be unrelated to the exhibit.

After watching A.K. Burns' piece in the other room, I decided to give the Resource Center an honest try. I listened to records, read books, and watched people come and go. I wound up getting inspired and found some useful material in both the curated and non-curated bookshelves. Very useful and enjoyable.

I stayed for a while, watching waves of people circle around the room for a few moments, reading the information on the wall and cycling out again. It seems to me people kind of regarded it as just another piece, though some seemed to stick around and be enjoying it as much as I was.

##My Version

I was skeptical at first but very much enjoyed this approach, and if I was to take a shot at doing a workshop for a museum it might be something like what I saw at the New Museum. Libraries can be awe inspiring with their breadth, but can sometimes be a bit daunting without a predetermined purpose.

The idea of a curated selection of books and materials appeals to me. It sets you off in a particular direction. Providing content that explains or augments what is currently exhibited in the museum is a natural fit. You see a piece of art, and sometime want to do something similar, be inspired to investigate the same subject in your own way, or need more context to understand the piece. Having the artist select the content is special, something that might not be presented in other museums, and is a connection with the artist that the audience normally would not have access to.

I was there on a Saturday, and there was quite the crowd on every floor. Simply providing a place where people could sit and rest a moment seemed like quite the revelation to me. I imagined my approach to this concept utilizing more space, perhaps in the cafe area. People could sit, perhaps even have some coffee or something to eat. This could give them a clearer message as to the purpose of the area: we want you to say here. In the Resource Center, I saw far too many people loop through the room quickly and leave. Really encouraging people to stay could make the endeavor more fruitful.

This could include having staff there, just to let people know it is OK to take the books off the shelf and read them. On particular days and times, they could do a mini-tour of the space. Pick up the books, put them in peoples hands, and explain why the artist chose that particular book. Talk at length about the music chosen, and encourage asking questions about the media (and be able to answer them). Finally, I think I would be powerful to have the artist themselves host one of these sessions at one point.
