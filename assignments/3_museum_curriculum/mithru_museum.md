# Visit to the Jewish Museum 

I visited the [Jewish Museum](http://thejewishmuseum.org/about) in the afternoon of the 11th of February, 2017.

> The Museum maintains a unique collection of nearly 30,000 works of fine art, Judaica, antiquities, folk art, ceremonial objects, and broadcast media which reflect the global Jewish experience over more than 4,000 years.

In addition to the permanent exhibit, I had the opportunity to witness *Pierre Chareau: Modern Architecture and Design*. As the name suggests, it was an exhibit about [Pierre Chareau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Chareau), a French designer and architect. I started my time at the museum with this exhibit. 

The exhibit featured Chareau's work, his influences, and external factors that shaped his life and work - like his move to New York as a result of German occupation of Paris during the war. As fascinating as the exhibit was, I will refrain from explaining it in this document. However, I must note an observation I made about the audience's interaction with certain parts. In particular, I saw two areas within the exhibit that went beyond what I would call "traditional" means of presenting at a museum. There was one section where I noticed a bigger crowd of people than anywhere else. When I went in there, I noticed there was a Virtual Reality experience of Chareau's architectural work. Another section where I saw a similar crowd was a moving projection of Chareau's one of architectural work. The similarity that I had noticed between the two was that information was being presented in an unconventional, yet interesting way.

Next, I went on to the permanent exhibit which I found quite enjoyable. There were artifacts I witnessed that taught me new things. The museum also had talks, performances and workshops for children, teenagers and families. Unfortunately, I didn't get to witness this, as there were none on the day I visited. However, there was plenty of information available on their website. 

One program that stood out in particular for me was *The Art of the Book* for children. The hands-on workshop invites students to explore parchments, reed pens and other resources that were used to produce medieval literary work. 

At the end, I pondered upon what it would take to make a similar exploratory experience for adults. I was really interested in the history that the museum presented, and felt that if I was to conduct a workshop for adults visiting the museum, that would be the central core of the curriculum. In my opinion, every single exhibit within the museum could be tied back to Jewish history. The texts, scrolls, artifacts, even Chareau's work, could be linked back to history. This would be presented as a guided tour that begins at the start of recorded history at the museum. The museum already seems to be set up chronological for the most part. Another thing I find frustrating is the lack of interaction with the objects on display. I understand that the original artifacts need to be preserved, but with the current state of 3D printing, duplicates can be made with relative ease. The audience members will be able to touch and interact with the duplicates of potentially everything on display, and maybe take home a souvenir.  

All in all, my visit was quite insightful, and in my opinion the museum is doing an amazing job at keeping their audience engaged. I ended the day by taking a long [walk along central park](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQZt_NTlxv5/?taken-by=mithru) to enjoy the view and collect my thoughts.

[UPDATED PLAN FOR WORKSHOP]
After thinking about the above and talking to my professor, Taeyoon, I started to wonder about other topics that interested me. I had recently seen digital [work by Casey Reas](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/text.html) supported by the Whitney museum. It was a re-creation of Sol LeWitt's work using code. 

Being a fan of LeWitt, Reas, math, patterns and code, I decided to pursue a workshop that combined these elements. This is what I ended up rehearsing with Daniella.

The intended curriculum would be to get hands on with permutations by using code, and eventually recreating a visual piece based on the work by LeWitt. This may be a direct recreation, or an appropriation of his work. The workshop is intended to be open and on-going, with all the visuals outcomes being collected [here](https://goo.gl/photos/rYXBmKccnKhhoaoeA).

The intended syllabus of the workshop is as follows:

1. Introduction to Sol LeWitt
2. LeWitt's wall drawings
3. Understanding Permutations and making calculations of them
4. Defining rules for our final visual piece(s)
5. Creating our visual piece (either through code, or hand drawn)
6. [Optional] Run through existing code built for this workshop
