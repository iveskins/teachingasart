This is the updated version of my attempt at creating a "museum workshop" - this did not happen in a museum. 
It was designed carefully to happen inside. 

I am extremely grateful for having the opportunity to redesign this experience, this learning experience in collaboration with my partner and momentaneous student Mithru. 
I did not expect to discover that the most powerful element of learning or knowledge is the possibility of an encounter. 
How basic and essential an encounter, the most primitive of forms- to consider the infinite potential of this. 

Before redesigning our workshops, we had several meetings and after some discussions we found out the following: 

Mithru Learning: 
multiple interests - think about it later - apply to something tangible- puzzles 
(Learn about myself, bursts of passion- look inside- Iâ€™m I asking too much?-everything happens because of something else- is there something larger- an individual affecting society-this close to not believing in reality- minor impact, give back- relation with the universe-
-alan watts-

Daniella Learning:
Asking questions about things; General curiosity about science and life; Finding beauty in these things. Interested in the brain, interconnectedness of things, fundamentals of basic sciences. Purpose and association. 


Mutual connections:  
The beauty of understanding, of observation. 
Physics
To wonder
Questions
