The music you listen to as soon as you step inside **Museo del Barrio** sets the mood for your whole visit. Probably because for me, the sounds behind some caribbean *salsa* or *bachata* have always represented that something good is about to start. On my visit on Saturday, I had the chance to see the exhibition by the Puerto Rican artist Beatriz Santiago Muñoz “A Universe of Fragile Mirrors”, that captures the community living conditions in Haiti and Puerto Rico, making reference to indigenous cosmologies and syncretic religions. The combinations of physical objects build with mirrors and audio visual representations made a really interesting combination to talk about this topic.

Unfortunately, the rest of the Museum was closed because some pipes broke. When I was leaving this exhibition, a huge wall called **“The People’s Wall”**, full of messages that seemed to be mainly from Latin American immigrants, called my attention. Those words were real, that carried a lot of emotional weight in them. In front of this wall, I saw a woman sitting in a table with a sign in the back that said “RESIST”. I was curious what was she doing there. I went closer and saw how in front of her, a poem that talked about building community and being brothers and sisters was written on the wall. She was talking to two other girls. I heard how these girls, that came from Los Angeles, where actually daughters of Mexican immigrants. I joined the conversation.

I spend there 2 hours, talking about communities, Latin America Folk Art (which is a topic I’m researching for my thesis), traditional protest music in Mexico, the consequences of gentrification... Francisca, that was the name of the woman, turned and ask me a lot about Peruvian Culture, and after the girls left, I just kept talking with her for a while. It was a really nice moment. This Chilean woman makes music and art as a way of protesting against gentrification in New York. She was also involved with the curation of the exhibition I mentioned before. And even though, there were some ideas I didn’t personally share with her, I felt that meeting her was an amazing experience that ended up creating a space for sharing ideas between people that even though don’t believe in the same mechanisms for change, care about the same topics. At the end, I needed to take a picture with her.

There was no one to talk to me about the Educational Program because it was Saturday, but I talked with some of the guards (they were extremely nice!), to the Colombian guy that was in the Gift Shop and to Francisca about it. I’ve had also researched previously about it on the webpage and if I had to describe it with one phrase, I would say it is a **“celebration of the Latin American culture through community building activities”**. It’s fascinating. 

One of the workshops they had recently was for Educators: learning about your community through cultural celebrations, as a way for them to replicate this practice in their schools. Unfortunately, not all the workshops going on right now are updated in the webpage.

For this assignment, I used was I saw as an inspiration and some of my Thesis research to designed my workshop. 

**WORKSHOP: MUSEO DEL  BARRIO**

We carry history with us, all the time. And those daily stories that involve people around us, that are part of our history is what fascinates me. Since I was a little girl, I always used to say “As my grandma told me… “, “My grandparent once told me the story about …”, “Nobody cooks as my grandma”… and so on. I’m sure we’ve all said it, no mather where we come from. Grandparents are a huge part of Latin American culture. We grow up with them, they take care of us while our parents are working, they play with us and become our confidents but also our partners in crime. Because of all the time we spend with them, we end up hearing so many stories about our family, our culture, our country, or the country where they came from, their personal stories, love stories, how they saw the world in their times and how they see it changing … all types of stories. I would even include some secret recipes and myths they made up to create a fantastic world in our minds. When time passes, we remember those stories with nostalgia. We tend to use them as references when we have conversations with people. I do that all the time. But when time passes, we tend to forget sometimes. It’s part of growing but also part of loosing that imagination we explore more as kids. And those stories, that talk so much about where we come from, may be lost. What if, based on the idea under which Folk Art was created in our cultures, we create physical objects that could keep these stories and that could let us share it with the world?

Workshop Name: **Como decía mi abuela.** (As my grandma used to say)

Curriculum:

Why Folk Art? To me Folk Art it's something that is produced by members of a social or ethnic group in a traditional way, handmade and conceived in a collective way that constitutes an expression of their cultural life. It's about building community, about collective storytelling and about making visible hidden stories.

Here, kids between 6 and 10 years, will explore those stories they’ve learn from their grandparents and design and handcraft objects that they will create where they can store these stories. There are no clear rules, except using their imagination and play with materials.

This workshop will be held every second Saturday of each month. The space is limited for 15 kids because of resources and materials, but also because I want them to be able to get in touch with those personal stories they have and have time to share them with everyone. It will last 3 hours, with a 15 minutes break in the middle. Between 2 and 3 teachers will be needed.

Organization:

A table full of different types of materials: pencils, markers, paint, peppers, cardboard, glue, scissors, fabric, stickers, thread will be available for them. At the beginning, they will share what they want to tell with the teachers and the other kids and they will start working with the materials, to make these stories real. We will also show examples of traditional Folk Art in Latin America and how and why these objects were created. All of this in a very dynamic way. 

At the end, everybody will share what they did and they will be able to take what they made home to keep it or to share it with more people.

Some thoughts: 

As I said in the beginning, Museo del Barrio is a celebration of Latin American Culture. Francisca was telling me how they always design activities that include the Latin community like the “The three kings Day Parade” that happens every January, where everyone designs torchlights and walk about the area. Complete families are part of this. When the Museum was created, it focused primarily on Art from Puerto Rico, but then it started expanding until they were able to englobe all the Latin American Community. If I had the opportunity of designing a workshop there, I would love to take those peculiarities that I feel are really present in our culture and give kids the possibility of exploring them. Specially because the number of sons and daughter from immigrants is huge, and even though they are part of a different culture for living here, I want them to have that connection to where they come from. **Como decía mi abuela**, could be a nice start for this.

Detailed syllabus:

**Como decía mi abuela **
*Workshop designed for Museo del Barrio*

This workshop has been designed for students between 8 - 12 years old, who are interested in exploring their creativity and in making things. The only thing they need is imagination and will to play with different materials. They will transform stories in physical objects that they could then take home.

**Learning objective:** In this class, students will learn about transforming stories into physical objects and using them as a tool for sharing experiences with other people. They will learn about traditional Folk Art in Latin America as an inspiration for them to develop their projects.

**Learning outcome:** Students will explore new ways of storytelling through the use of physical materials. Each of them will choose a story based on their experience and craft an object that makes reference to that story.

It will last 1 hour with a 15 minutes break in the middle.
