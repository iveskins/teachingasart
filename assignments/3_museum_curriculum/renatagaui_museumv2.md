# (reestructuring) In between the – dashes : personal narratives for a night 

Last week I proposed a creative writting workshop  for The Morgan Library's current exhibition "I'm nobody! Who are you?" that is abut the personal life & work of american poet Emily Dickinson. The workshop would focus on her usage of the dashes, that according to the museum's guide, could have many meanings - could be a breathing pause, a pause for a thought, a word play, a curse etc. 

I was paired with Ruta and after class we realized we barely had common available hours, which restrained our workshops to last 01 hour each. So that made me go through a lot of changes on the structure of a overnight workshop to a 60 minutes one. I looked through her learning map but I had in mind that if this was an actual workshop I wouldnt' have access to everybody's map, so I adapted a bit to the fact that she likes having some alone time to learn.


## In between the – dashes : personal narratives for a night

### About the 01 hour workshop
This workshop invites the audience to do a one hour warm up creative writing exercise over Emily Dickinson's usage of the dash. The participants are exposed to her work and invited to explore how dashes are used in different contexts. At the end, workshop atendees will share the work produced and estimulated to think about personal use of dashes.
