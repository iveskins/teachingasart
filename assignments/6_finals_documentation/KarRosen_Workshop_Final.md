***Female Figures in Art***

**Audience:** Students in Highschool to Graduate School, teens and adults who have an interest in Art History and Feminism

**Workshop content:**  We will once again revisit the history of art, highlighting artworks depicting women made by women on display at the museum. We will learn the lives and stories behind the artist and the painting, and discuss. A creative activity will follow.

**Learning objectives:** Students gain a more well-rounded knowledge of art history, and more mindfulness to sexism in the arts.

**Prompts to Ask the Audience:**

* *What do you see in the painting?*
* *What do you relate to you? /What resounds with you the most?*
* *Are there any parallels to modern artists that you might see?*

**Creative Activity:** *A Day In The Life:* Students assume the role of painter themselves or either one of the artists contemporary or themselves as a person living in the time of the painter. Write a small piece about the piece shown: it can be a diary entry, newspaper article or review of the piece. Alternatively, participants can reverse the role, assuming the role of artists covered and create something they might in contemprary times. (Or for those who might want to paint, to paint their own piece inspired by one of the women mentioned in the workshop.)
