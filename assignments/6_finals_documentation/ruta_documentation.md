**Goal of the workshop:** to encourage adults to unlearn how to ask questions and look for information. Also to encourage them to think about the big questions and look for answers through a collaborative work.

# Structure of the workshop:

*Part I:*

**3min:** Introduction

  - Welcome: goal of the workshop & how long it will be
	
  - Einstein’s quote
	
  - Introductions: around the table & what are you curious about?

**3min:** Introduction

  - What is Unlearning
  
  - Sugata Mitra: studied how children learn
  
  - My thesis: same but with adults: necessary unlearning
  
**10min:** Warm up exercises

  - A2B2C
  
  - 5 Whys: explain what it is & try one
  
**1min: Question 1: What would happen if Earth was a different shape?**

**3min:** Following 5 Whys approach: write down a list of questions that would lead to answering a big question

**2min:** Rules of play (can look online, but only with one laptop per group)

**15min:** Exploring the answer on their own

**10min:** Presentation & discussion

**TOTAL: 47min**

*Part II:*

**1min: Question 2: Why do we forget?**

**3min:** Writing down a list of questions that would lead to answering a big question

**1min:** Additional rules of play (can’t look online, make new groups, someone you haven’t worked with yet before)

**20min:** Exploring on their own

**10min:** Presentation & discussion

**10min:** Final discussion & feedback

**TOTAL: 45min**

## Rules of play

  - Self-organize a group of 3
  
  - If needed, you can change group at any time
  
  - Information can be freely shared among groups
  
  - All groups share the same resources
  
  - No Internet access & no computers (for the second question)
  
  - Pick a person who would document the process (questions along the way, if they changed)
  
  - I’m here only to observe

  -Presentations should prompt discussion

## Resources

Books, Internet, sheets of paper, pencils, crayons

# Feedback

Feedback was done in a form of a discussion at the end of the workshop.

### Feedback questions

  - Which question was easier to work with? Why?
  
  - Which one was the "bigger" question?
  
  - Which rules of play were easier / better for process? (Internet vs. books as resources)
  
  - How was it to work in a group?
  
  - Did the list of questions change at some point?

  - Have you become more curious about any of the topics?

  - Any new things that you didn’t know?
  
  - Did you feel like you had to unlearn anything?
  
### Participants' feedback

*Questions:*

  - The question 1 (What would happen if Earth was a different shape?) might need more structure as it was hard to understand which direction to go (participants had a lot of “if” questions)

  - Liked the question 2 (Why do we forget?) because it was open-ended and could be more related to people's previous experiences

*Build up:*

  - Not everybody liked 5 Whys approach because not all adults like solution-based thinking

  - People also felt that the warm up exercises we did at the beginning of the workshop set the mood to answer questions with asking even more questions and not solutions (something I didn’t expect)

*Process:*

  - Liked the idea of building a collective mental model, where they could add to one another's thoughts and questions (exercise of writing down smaller questions that could lead to answering a big question)

  - Some expressed a thought that more time might be needed to reflect on the answer and then work within the group

  - Some needed more time to work on the answers might give more in-depth responses (others disagreed)

  - None of the people looked at books: some mentioned that books remind them of school as an institution and contradict with unlearning process

  - Each group took each question very differently (some tried to find solutions, others looked at speculative possibilities)

  - It took some time to adjust to work with people in a group that you haven’t worked before (to understand how they process things)

  - Working in a group was some sort of unlearning, because each person came with their own questions and then had to hear other people’s views and find a common ground to look for an answer

*Additional takeaways:*

  - Adults have more previous experiences and context, so their answers are more philosophical

  - Big, more open-ended questions work well as prompts to make adults ask even more questions

  - Majority of people were more interested in an open-ended question (#2) rather than, as they said, “scientific one” (even though both questions were meant to be completely scientific)
