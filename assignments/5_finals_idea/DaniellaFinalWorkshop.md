Workshop: Thinking The Interior (structures-of-hope)
Location: 315 Berry St BK, NY
Time: (TBA)
[Materials will be provided] 


The distance between two individuals dictate a certain geometry. How can we render visible the infinite interconnections of space?
Can we create a unit of measurement to study the morphology that connects all aspects of life, the worlds we share? 
Humans are beings that participate in spaces unknown to physics. Vital space can only be explained in terms of the priority of the inside: 
because humans cannot reside in the point, in the beginning there was the bubble.
This workshop is an opportunity for curiosity, to explore the inside and make connections. 
To acquire the abilities needed to formulate the right questions, that can lead to your own discoveries.

We will study this by experimenting with light, time and space; gaining access to something that is the most real, 
yet also the most elusive and least tangible of things: 
self-realizing forms (spheres)

An intimacy of roundness, the beauty of an idea.
This workshop is about a process, my process 
and I would like to share it with you.

Agenda: (3h)

- “…Because humans cannot reside in a point, in the beginning there was the bubble." (Peter Sloterdijk)

+ Experiment #0: We make a bubble with infniite air/ We look at a bubble in VR and code / We make a bubble with Arduino/Sensor. 

- Introduction and explanation of workshop's structure

+ Experiment #1 (10min) Draw: time / light / space

- Watch 1min Video Richard feynman + Bruno Munari

-Explore concepts : Surface Tension, Light, Time 

(We will find connections and research artists: Tomas Saraceno /  olafur eliasson / Wolfgang Laib)

-Concepts (deep dive)

-Try: An Idea
 [Find an ongoing (thought, question, obsession, dream)
 open it up - in and out - go deeper - find connections -draw the network - what is that space, how does it look like?
 
 -Compare (Mercury Fountain)
 
 +Experiment#3 (1:30hr) Structures of Hope (Materials provided)
