**Workshop Title:**  *Female Figures in Art*

**Length:** 2-3 hours

**Proposed Date:**  March 15th, 2017 11 AM- 3 PM

**Workshop Description:**  
We will once again revisit the history of art, highlighting artworks depicting women made by women on display at the museum. We will learn the lives and stories behind the artist and the painting, and discuss. A creative activity will follow.

**Learning objectives:**
 Students gain a more well-rounded knowledge of art history, and more mindfulness to sexism in the arts.

**Activity:**  
*A Day in the Life:*  Students assume the role of painter themselves or either one of the artists contemporary or themselves as a person living in the time of the painter. Write a small piece about the piece shown: it can be a diary entry, newspaper article or review of the piece. (Or for those who might want to paint, to paint their own piece inspired by one of the women mentioned in the workshop.)
