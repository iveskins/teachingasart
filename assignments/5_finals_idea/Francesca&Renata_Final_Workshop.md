**A workshop about empowering women through weaving**

**Renata's previous work: Penelope**

*The Odyssey’s excerpt about Penelope and the weaving loom points out a powerful moment of women empowerment in Homer’s famous literature. The installation consists on a tapestry loom that starts to weave when the sun rises and unweaves with the sunset. In ancient greek burial rituals the deceased one was dressed in a full length white shroud – as if the closer the loom gets to have the piece done, the more Penelope is confined to her own imprisonment.*

**Francesca's previous work: Quipu**

*Quipu was a project about creating a new language that ties together the old ways of telling and archiving stories with the new ways of consuming them. It was a physical installation inspired by a recording device used in the Incan Empire made of cords and knotted strings of different colors to capture elements of Oral Traditions. Interaction with it, revealed daily stories collected from local communities that talk about their cultural identity and their own way of seeing society.*

**About the idea**

The more we studied, the more we realized how weaving has a tight attachment with women and how through time women have empowered themlseves through this craft, in an individual and collective scale. This type of activity helps building stronger women, women that we aspire to be one day. For them, inspired by them. 

*how can we make a homage to these women?*

*when does empowerment (external tool) becomes strength (internal tool)?*

*how can we make a homage to these women that through their strength they became our empowering tool?*

**The workshop**

In the spirit of Women’s month, this workshop is a great opportunity to invite people to think who are the empowering females in their lives and how they can celebrate them through weaving. 

Date: March 18th

Amount of people: Approximately 10, no minimum/maximun age.

Each person will be instigated to think about one female that they feel extremely inspired by and to weave a piece in homage to her. Later, this weaving will be sent to those people with a postcard/letter from the weaver. 

This workshop is open to the whole community. It will teaching basic techniques of weaving as well as instigating attendees to celebrate the females in their lives.
