# Exploring permutations in visual art through the works of Sol LeWitt

**Abstract**  

This workshop is a collaborative exploration of the mathematical concept of permutations using the work of Sol LeWitt as its lens. The workshop will explain the concept technically, and its usage in the arts. At the end, participants will have the opportunity to collaborate with each other to create visual artworks based on the workshop.

**Syllabus**

1. Introduction to Sol LeWitt's Wall drawings
2. Introductions to Permutations 
	- Counting in base 10 (decimal)
	- Counting in base 2 (binary)
	- Calculations within the group
3. Creating simple rules for visual patterns
4. Recreating Sol LeWitt's work
	- Hand-drawn
	- Through code (optional - will be discussed at the start of the workshop)
5. Group Work 
	- Split into groups
	- Create main rules for group design
	- Individually create a patterns, and draw it out
	- Create permutations of patterns for group design
6. Feedback, discussion and call to action 
	- Upload patterns for online pool of automatically generated permutations

This workshop is intended to take place over 3 hours in one sitting. There will be two 10 minute breaks - one at the end of section 2, and another at the end of section 4.

**Intended Audience**    

This workshop is intended to be a casual afternoon workshop for adults interested in the intersection of mathematics and visual art work. It is meant to be a social event - participants will form groups organically and collaborate to create work. If the audience is interested in creating work through code, the workshop will be lead accordingly.

Maximum number of participants : 20.
