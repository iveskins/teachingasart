**Virtual Gallery Workshop**

Personally I believe artists would always want to have their solo exihibition in order to demonstrate their unique works, but not many people would have this chance due to various limitations. For the purpose of achieving this utopian idea that everyone could have their solo exhibition, I would like to make a workshop that help can help every artists to create their solo exhibition or open studio through a non physical/virtual medium - web.

Web is literally accessible to everyone, and that really serves the purpose of an exhibition. Somehow in this case it would be even better since people have higher availabilities in non-physical form.

**Objective:** The workshop will guide people to create his or her virtual solo exhibition, which you would have full control of the space, sound, lights and run-time without worrying anything.

**Who:** Artists and curators who are interested in experimenting such notion with digital medium.

**Process:**
- Gather your works that you think might suitable to present in a virtual form, and prepared them in digital format (eg. paintings/images/photographs as PNG, sculptures/installations as 3D models and etc).

- Design your gallery space. Expected result - generates your unique floor plan.
Potential Tools: Any 3D editor that is preferred (Blender, C4D, Maya and etc).

- Assemble your works and floor plan into a coding environment. Adjust the positioning, lighting, material, sound(if necessary), materials of your works in the gallery. The user experience could either be FPS or webVR.
Potential Tools: Three.js .

- Upload the site, and welcome everyone.

**Duration:** The workshop will be divided into three sessions, one for part2 and two for part 3. Each session will run up to 1 and half hours.

**Setting:** The workshop would take place within a private art studio.
