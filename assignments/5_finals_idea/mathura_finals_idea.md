## Curriculum - workshop

### What?

For a while now, I have been interested in the idea of opening up a maker space in my hometown -[Bangalore,India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). I want the space to promote a sense of community, local culture and also be inclusive of the rapidly changing technologies around us.
I have started building up a [small information website](http://mathuramg.com/FilterKaapi/) about this as well.

For the finals of this class, I am interested in working on an introductory maker workshop that breaks out into a series of workshops.
*Provide exposure that is an inch deep and a mile wide.*

### Why?
The larger aim of such a space is to foster a sense of community and coming up with creative solutions to everyday problems. This community aims to give people the confidence and sense of empowerment needed to pursue their goals.

### Introductory workshop - Details
Make a complete "thing" in 2-3 hours in groups of 3-4.
The projects are partially pre-made. This is to promote the idea of curiosity and to encourage the people to come back.

**Topics -**
* Something familiar from home - to reduce the entry barrier into the concept itself and to also promote the rich culture of where you are from. (In India, this could be a rangoli making machine!)
* Topics that use technology (read electronics and codding) but don't completely rely on it. For instance, we would not be making a  bluetooth controlled car.
* Ideas that encourage looking at the space aroud you and seeing how you can affect it. (Eg - smart home architecture)

**Tools**
I think it is important that the tools used by the people in the workshop are not completely alien to them. Along with the multimeter, solder gun and other phys-comp components, it is important to have familiar tools like paper, fabric, needles etc.

### The actual PROJECT
Right now I am toying with the below ideas. Over the next few days, I wish to focus on the topic and add details to it.
* Rangoli making machine
* Add designer lights to your house
* Music while you cook

### The Format (Roughly)
Each project will have it's own "station" manned by 2 people. Post a brief overview, the participants will be given "kits" that will contain what they need for their project along with instructions. The volunteers will be there to help and overlook the process, but the idea is for the participants to explore and build the final objects on their own.
