Example of adults answering a few big questions: [https://soundcloud.com/ruta-kruliauskaite/curiosity](https://soundcloud.com/ruta-kruliauskaite/curiosity)

The issue I have with it is that adults would more likely say "I know" or "I don't know" but not let themselves explore and come up with these theories (exactly the opposite what children would do).

I want to explore what it would take to make adults explore and think about these big questions.

A few things to consider to make that happen: time (what's the good structure of the workshop?), questions (maybe I should define more abstract questions that experts can't answer), resources (should I limit access to Internet and use only physical resources: books, etc.?)
