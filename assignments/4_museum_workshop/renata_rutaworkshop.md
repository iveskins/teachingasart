# Collaborative Workshop by Ruta – Feedback

Last friday Ruta gave a creative collaboration workshop. Since she was working with the New Museum, she started the workshop introducing me to the work of Raymond Pettibon, an american punk rock artist. His illustrations are very rough and almost comic like. They all are talking about specific moments of history and (in my opinion) even if you can't understand what is written on the canvas, you can have an idea of the emotion through the characters & movement illustrations. 

Then we watched a video that MOCA did with him, showing him in his studio and creative process – that culminates in the interviewer and the artist collaborating on a drawing. Inspired on that collaboration, she proposed we did a collaborative drawing. But before that, we went through a few warm up creative exercises.

The first exercise she proposed I was a bit familiar with. The A-B word technique that later became A-C is always an activity that I enjoy doing. We were just working with each other, so one really positive point was that starting the warm up part Ruta stepped down as the lecturer and was doing the exercises with me. It felt very comfortable to be engaged in the activities since it was a more of a horizontal structure.

Then we did a drawing exercise in which we picked a noun, an adjective and a verb and we had to draw it. Another good aspect about this workshop was that Ruta was on track of time, so I knew how much time I'd have before I started doing something. That helped me thinking about how polished the drawing had to be – and being inspired by Pettibon's work, it was going to have a sketch aesthetic anyways.

After this, we had a moment to talk about the warm ups and how we felt while creating and taking decisions not previously planned. This moment was followed by the last exercise in which we both draw on a paper collaborative. So one did one part of the drawing, the other responded to that on the same paper. Almost as if we were doing the A-B but drawing. At first we were waiting each other  finish their part to then start drawing but at some point we were just comfort enough to just go drawing at the same time.

I think this workshop was a good introduction into creative exercises and collaborative creation. I just wish it was longer and I wonder how things would be if there were more people and if the collaborations were beyond the paper.
