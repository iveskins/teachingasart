Last week I took Jen's workshop on "Who owns Kafka?" and how Judith Butler was not allowed to speak at the Jewish Museum in New York. I really enjoyed it!

Jen totally read my Learning Map because the way the workshop was structured and designed was perfect for what I enjoy when participating in one. She even prepared some beautiful slides to guide the workshop. After setting the environment, by talking about my relationships with Jewish people and what I knew and didn't about them, she started tellig the story of what happened in 2014 when Judith Butler was not allowed to speak. We went through some political and social issues around the Israeli - Palestinian conflict situation to create a context for her to explain what happened.

Also, we ended up having a really interesting conversation about what's the Jewish cultural asset, what defines that?, who owns our identity? and even going beyong the topic of the workshop, but talking more about culture and identity in general. 

It was really well lead and I learned a lot about a topic that I don't normally feel related to. I think it was really interesting to have a conversation abot topics that come from the main idea of the workshop. It makes me think a lot about one quote from one of the readings we had about the syllabus **"Be comfortable teaching the class that is happening rather than the class you intended to teach".** 

Here's also a picture of Jen taking my workshop:
