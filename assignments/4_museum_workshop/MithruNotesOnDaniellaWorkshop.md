**Feedback for Dani**

Daniella's workshop began with us creating a bubble together on a slide. We observed it, made it pop, and created it again.

Immediately after that, we viewed a similar bubble in a VR headset. [Link here](https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/bubble/)

She then asked me what the difference between the two was. After a lot of tries, I gave up. She expected me to notice that the real bubble popped, but the virtual one did not. 

The next part of the workshop was hands-on again. I was given three pieces of paper and a pencil, and was asked to visualize space, time and light, which I did by just folding the paper. 

We then looked at the work of [Tomas Saraceno](http://tomassaraceno.com/), and discussed the unknown, our existence within the unknown, and how it related to life and the presentation itself.

At the end, Dani asked that I think about the bubbles of topics I find myself interested in, and dig deeper to find projects that help me explore those topics.

Overall, the workshop was quite interesting. I really enjoyed the real world observation of the bubble, and the hands-on making of them. I understood that the entire workshop was to present the idea of interconnectedness, but I feel that could be given more importance in the way it was presented. I loved the exploration of Saraceno's work as well. One note that I had was regarding the workshop was about how this would be presented to larger groups. I feel this works great with groups of upto 5 people, but might be difficult to handle with too many people.

**Feedback from Dani**  

*What was your biggest takeaway/learning from the workshop?*  
A mix between numbers and human connection. I guess my biggest takeaway is precisely that, finding the connection between learning and human emotions. 

*In what way was it relevant and helpful to you  personally?*    
I desperately need to learn code : / 
and I am always looking for ways to understand the mathematical aspects of this. 
Your workshop gave me one thing that I truly needed: the space to slow down and digest the information in an interesting and aesthetic manner. 

*To whom would you recommend this workshop?*  
fellow designers/artists and children 

*How would you describe the workshop in one line to explain it to the person(s) in the previous question? (around 10 words)*  
Learn how to see math as a drawing with code. 

*What did you feel was missing in the workshop?*  
I would have liked a bigger screen to interact with or an environment.
The tactile aspect. 

*What were your thoughts about showing the code? Was it needed for the workshop? Would the workshop be the same if it was just a tool that allowed you to draw different patterns?*  
For me the code element was essential because it allows you to compare and understand structures and ultimately reality. I think if you combine actual drawing in the wall with a ruler and pencil, doing this just as Sol Lewitt did, and using a projector to trace the lines in the wall that you are doing with code.. that could be really nice and engaging. 

*Any additional comments and feedback? What have I not asked in this form that you think I should have asked?*  
Maybe talk a bit more about the concept behind Sol Lewitt's drawings.. there is a lot of very interesting ideas and writings about it..maybe for a coder -not an artist- knowing more about the art part could be interesting and engaging. Push the comfort zone.
