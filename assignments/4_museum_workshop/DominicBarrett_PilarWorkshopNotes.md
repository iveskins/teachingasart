Pilar's workshop was titled "Perspectives on Feminism in Latin America". After some discussion, it was explained that she considered this perhaps part of an ongoing series (I'm already interested, now), and that this first session was focusing on Mexico.

I was asked why I might be interested in taking this course. We had been talking about feminism, and I mention that. But also the fact that the US and Mexico are neighbors, and as such we should know each other better. This offers a perfect segway into her first text reference, "Distant Neighbors" by Alan Riding.

Pilar not only directly addressed the "why" of taking a course, but had an answer qued up to smoothly go into her presentation. Good move.

History was outlined, emphasizing the concept of female betrayal as a deep seated part of national identity. Multiple examples, literary, audio and visual are outlined (someone certainly read my learning map!).

"The Idol and The Saint"

The core concepts are laid out, but also offered up with some personal anecdotes. During which I am encouraged to ask questions, and we have a conversation. Not only do I get to ask some questions, clarify some concepts and details, but also ask about her personal experiences and put them into context.


I very much enjoyed the workshop. As with all of our workshops, I wonder how it will scale. But being that it is a more traditional class-type environment, I believe it is readily suited to scale right now. This could easily be implemented as a supplimentary activity to a showing of certain Mexican art, as a means to contextualize specific themes that would have not been fully appreciated by someone without the cultural knowledge (like myself).



I'm now going to be adding the survey questions about my workshop, A tour of the New Museum's Resource Center as curated by AK Burns, and her current piece "Shabby but Thriving".

----------------------------------

Survey for Dominic Barrett's Museum Workshop: The Resource Center and AK Burns

Did you know about the New Museum's Resource Center before attending this workshop?

  - No! I didn't!


What extra materials from the Resource Center do you remember the most?

  - I remember the books the most, because of their eye-catching titles. However, the punching bag and the records were also fun to interact with (punch/listen to)


Was the workshop attendant helpful and useful? How, or how not?

  - Yes! It was useful! I had never heard of AK Burns before and it was lovely to have such a contextualized and thorough first approach to the artist and her process. 


What else would you like to see included in this workshop?

  - Perhaps a handout with the listing of the media that was in the Resource Center would be nice, just to have a reference to the material later.
