*I was inspired by Taeyoon’s suggestion of a treasure map. Having fun while learning is important! The following is a roleplaying/pretend type map that should be taken as a metaphorical approach to teaching me a concept. Simply: finding novel ways or pieces of information to pique interest, giving multiple contexts and perspectives on the subject, confirming that the basics have been absorbed, and encouraging ways to further expand knowledge beyond the current lesson.*

*Actively pretending to be a secret agent is not required, though is enjoyable.*



Hello agent,

We have discovered a location of interest that requires further investigation. Provided is the current set of data; a series of maps surrounding the country, city, and building in question.

However, our knowledge of the building is incomplete. Your mission is to more fully understand it’s function and what happens inside. You must circle the city in order to understand it’s place in the country, circle the building to understand it’s place in the city, explore all floors to understand their place in the building.

While these map routes are a start, expect to improvise. Adjacent countries, cities, and buildings may provide leads. Also, your starting intel is two dimensional but the world is not. There may be worthwhile information above and below, in scientific and social investigation. Ask HQ for further intel as required, and we will try to help you as best we can.

Though this mission is exploratory in nature, you will need to memorize the fundamentals. The first three maps give you the starting knowledge you will need to arrive at the target and further pursue your mission. Our interest in this target must not be known, hence these materials will be destroyed after you have committed them to memory. A senior agent will provide these materials, answer any questions you may have, but most importantly they will ensure you have memorized these fundamental pieces of information before properly disposing of them.

These materials have been procured at great cost. You may be expected to pass along this information in addition to whatever you discover on your mission to other agents.

Thank you and good luck.
-HQ
