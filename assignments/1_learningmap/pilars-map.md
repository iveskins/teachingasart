Although I don't feel like I came up with straightforward, systematic approach to describe my learning process, 
I did notice some patterns that repeat themselves over and over each time I want to learn something new: 

First, the obvious. I have to want to learn something [1]. If not, it'll be white noise to me. 
I then try to determine if I have any knowledge in the subject or not [2]. 
If I do, I try to review and/or and bring to memory what it is I know of the subject [2-A]. I I then try to see how this new piece of knowledge 
is different from what I already know [2-A1]. I try to analyze if the approach is on the same line of that which I already know
or if it challenges it[2-A2]. If it challenges it...oh, boy, I won't rest until I've thought about/discussed/wondered about this conflict and 
settle it either by trying to make this two visions coincide or settling with one [2-A3]. 

However, if the topic in question is entirely new to me [2-B], Iâ€™ll usually look for 101 references and the most basic building blocks of that subject [2-B1].
But, there's a trap here though, sometimes I'll go down the rabbit hole and won't get to do the actual work cause I have trouble knowing when to stop this 'pre-learning' thing. 
But, in a scenario where my context research is moderate and appropiate, and once I feel confident enough with the basics, I delve into the subject in question: 

I read, I listen, I ask questions, I do tutorials, I jot down notes. A lot of notes [3]. 
Real life examples to abstract concepts, metaphors for complex systems 
and mnemonic devices for those things that one must commit to memory are great tools for me, I've found. 

Then, if some deliverable product is required, I do the work [4]. Once done, I'll try to perfect it as much as I can [5].
I almost never have time for this, though. 

Finally, I then I try to understand how this new piece of knowledge fits into my general understanding of the world[6]. 

And then finally, I reflect if I want to keep on digging deeper into the subject [7], and if I do, I start the cycle all over again.
