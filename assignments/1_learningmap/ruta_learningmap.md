Below are two maps that show how I learn: one when I want to learn a new subject that is not necessarily practical and another when I want to learn a new skill.
You can see that what helps me learn is talking to people and then finding time to work on my own until I can regroup with people again. I love coming up with my own instructions for everything I need or want to learn. This way I have more ownership and feel more responsibility over what I do.
I always need to see where my learning is going (even if it’s something I come up for myself) and understand the “why” – otherwise I see no point and have no motivation in doing it at all. I need hands-on approach, not only theory, because practice leads to understanding and to wanting to know theory, which leads to more practice.
Of course, all of it is an iterative process: if in the process of learning I discover more things I don’t know, I go back to breaking them down and so on until I can say: “Ok, I think I’ve got it…”
