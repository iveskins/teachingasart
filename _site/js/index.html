This class is for artists and creative practitioners who want to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themselves. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning process with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces such as Artist-run schools, Hackerspaces and Museums.

Learning objective: In this class, students will learn about applying artistic processes to teaching. Students will read about the history of artists in and out of academic institutions, Black Mountain College as well as more recent experiments. Students are expected to engage in a critical discussion about the topic.

Learning outcome: Students will become knowledgeable about various ways of teaching. Students will create a lesson plan for a workshop.

## Letter 1 
 
Dear class.

My name is Taeyoon, I will be teaching "Teaching as Art" in Spring 2017 at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/). 

I hope you are enjoying the winter holidays. I'd like to share some thoughts and reading materials. These readings are not mandatory. I'm sharing them as an opportunity for those who want to observe and participate in my preparation for the class.

### This class will be about the art of teaching. 

"Art work deals with the problem of a piece of art, but more, it teaches the process of all creating, the shaping out of the shapeless. We learn from it that no picture exists before it is done, no form before it is shaped. The conception of a work gives only its temper, not its consistency. Things take shape in material and in the process of working it, and no imagination is great enough to know before the works are done what they will be l	ike."

– Anni Albers *We Need the Crafts for their Contact with Materials,*  Design, 46:4. December 12, 1944 [Link](http://albersfoundation.org/teaching/anni-albers/texts/#tab3)

### This class will be a space for dialogue.  

"Because love is an act of courage, not of fear, love is commitment to others. No matter where the oppressed are found, the act of love is commitment to their cause—the cause of liberation. And this commitment, because it is loving, is dialogical. As an act of bravery, love cannot be sentimental; as an act of freedom, it must not serve as a pretext for manipulation. It must generate other acts of freedom; otherwise, it is not love. Only by abolishing the situation of oppression is it possible to restore the love which that situation made impossible. If I do not love the world—if I do not love life—if I do not love people—I cannot enter into dialogue." 

– Paulo Freire, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, 1970, page 89~90 [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed)

### This class will an attempt to create a community of future teachers.  

"The class, in each new iteration, has created a temporary community, a way of being together where dissent, difference, and respect co-exist, although sometimes painfully. At its most successful, we all risk a kind of vulnerability in relation to knowledge, each other, and our work, and a thoughtful slowing-down that goes against the kind of hyper-rational certainty and mastery that has been so disastrous and duplicitous in the hands of power. In some ways our cultural “rationality” is a lifeboat, the medium through which we become habituated to the endless state of emergency as described by Walter Benjamin, where the task is to “manage” unimaginable crises, from an oceanic oil gush to endless war. The way we look, sense, and feel are all components of our thinking, all crucial to resisting the mechanisms of the “societies of control.” The question remains for all artists, thinkers, writers, and teachers who try to do the work we do mindfully, and politically: does slowing down mitigate against urgency, against agency, when so much needs to be both done and undone? The question can only be answered in a spirit of optimism, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. We must continually reinvent the tools we use to unpack, unlearn, learn and rebuild, to create the kind of change we want to make—in the present tense, mindful of the past, and “for the future” too."

“I have only apparently strayed from computers to poetry. Or rather: the opposition many people see between computers and poetry is quite profoundly false. In fact my present thesis would not suffer much from being re-stated as: the embodiment of mathematics in properly designed computers is the most powerful means we have for giving it poetical, cultural and personal-human dimensions which are a necessary condition for it to be accepted and absorbed in a natural and easy way by billions of children. So I shall turn back to computers and mention some of the ways in which they can play this poetogenic role.

How can we establish a link between mathematics and beauty? For those of us who become (through who knows what lucky accidents) mathematicians this bridge has become strong enough for us to see the deepest beauty in abstract mathematics itself. But if we are not to rely on accidents we need the means to link mathematics with aspects of beauty which already touch the aesthetic sensibilities of the non-mathematician.”

– Seymour Papert, *Some Poetic and Social Criteria for Education Design*, 1976. [Link](http://www.papert.org/articles/SomePoeticAndSocialCriteriaForEducationDesign.html)

### * I suggest you learn a magic trick.*

<section data-markdown>

"Over the course of the term, I thought often of Ursula K. Le Guin’s novel A Wizard of Earthsea. Ged, the titular wizard, goes to study with Ogion, a magician who seems more like a Zen monk. Ogion refuses to cast spells. When it rains, they sit in the rain. When they are hungry, Ogion and Ged forage for food. They wander like tramps, picking herbs. Ged, impatient with this humility, sneaks a glance at Ogion’s spell books and performs a summoning ritual. Things get way out of control, and Ged gets one glimpse of Ogion actually performing magic with a glowing staff (the simple walking stick of the herb-gathering tours), fending off the demon Ged summoned.

Ged leaves Ogion, and travels to a magic school (uncannily prescient of Hogwarts), and there learns illusions, epic poems, the language of dragons, and all the other trappings of wizardry. It’s not until the fourth Earthsea volume that Ogion finds a keeper of a student, Tehanu. During Tehanu’s tutelage, pretty much nothing happens. The two chat, tell stories, and generally meander about. At one point a dragon does show up, and, after a brief conversation, flies off.

This, of course, is the model of our contemporary art program. We sit around the table, talking about this and that, the uses of herbs and hearsay anecdotes. For passing dragon read “visiting artist,” who flits through and perhaps issues a scorching critique. As a teacher, I want to be Ogion of the first Earthseabook. The students, called by their talent, are impatient to learn and practice the secrets of Art. But why not refuse to teach the big spells, the big effects, or task them with any quest at all? They should understand the materials at hand, the basic flow of life. " 

– Dan Torop, an excerpt from *Draw it with your eyes closed. Art of the Assignment*, 2012, [Link](http://drawitwithyoureyesclosed.com/post/66102696583/dan-toropa-wizard-of-earthsea)
