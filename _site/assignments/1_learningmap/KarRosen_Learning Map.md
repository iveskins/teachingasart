Hello! :D

My learning style (interest in subject aside), is a mix of visual and kinesthetic learning, paired with a group feedback or peer review like situation. The visual part is important, I need clear, concise wording with instructions that is more 
or less spelling everything out. Paired with clear images for better comprehension. It can be a step by step tutorial, 
or a lecture with graphs, cartoons, even slides with memes just to help illustrate the idea. 
Listening to audio only is sometimes difficult, as auditory processing issues are not uncommon with people on the autism spectrum. 
Pair that with a physical component, like a tangible book for me to read. Or if it is like, for example, a Physical Computing Lab, 
allow me to follow along. Doing the act and repeating it also helps to retain the information.

On the topic of  feedback, I like a  collective casual jam session, or critique. 
The exchange of ideas from other perspectives, or even discuss theoretical and do a sort of thought experiment. 
To talk it out-- or sometimes just have write it out since sometimes public talking causes me to get anxious. 
(I'm still working on it, I am definitely better than I was years ago, but I still have a long way to go).  
Pair that with remarking what is the strong point as well as the weak point of the project. 
I also personally don't like the idea of the silent creator during feedback. 
I would like the chance for the creator to explain their reasoning behind the the thing that is critiqued, 
or wait until after all of the feedback is addressed. 
It is a conversation with the intent of comprising with the critic's issues with the creator's vision and 
move forward for further revisions.
