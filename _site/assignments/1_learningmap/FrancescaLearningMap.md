my learning process. 

I know I’m a person that gets easily distracted, especially because my brain tents to focus on details and sometimes those are not necessarily the most important parts of the lecture. That’s why when I’m sitting at a class I really wanna learn from, at least at the beginning I put all my senses and focus into what I’m listening. While the class moves on, if I feel comfortable with what I’m learning, I tend to relax a little bit and start thinking about it in a more abstract way.

Learning something new gets my brain really exciting. It’s like having a tiny person inside my head jumping all over the place when I feel that “click” that happens when everything you are hearing/watching/imaging/feeling makes sense. It also makes me feel empowered, because learning opens more possibilities for me and that’s super exciting! I’m a person that needs to take notes by hand or at least have a notebook and a pen (and one that lets me play with my handwriting!) in front of me. I don’t like taking notes in the computer, unless its completely necessary, being told to memorize something without an explanation or to so things just.because.they.say.so. 

If it’s a class where people are sharing their own projects, knowing the story behind them is fascinating for me. That means understanding where their thoughts and inspiration came from, because normally it makes me think about things I never thought before. It also gives me the possibility to open my brain and to explore inside myself different ways of getting inspired. 

I’m also a more visual person, which means that huge blocks of code with.no.space.in.between are not gonna work with me. Pictures, videos, life demos, drawings, lines of code with the proper format, colors, specific quotes, typographies… help me a lot. 

For understanding my ideal learning process, these are the 4 steps you need to follow:
