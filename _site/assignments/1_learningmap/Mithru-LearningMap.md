#Mithru's Learning Map

The image below explains how I think I learn, against a scale of my interest in that subject. It's important to note that this interest level changes based on numerous factors which I will explain with an example in the next paragraph. The image starts at the bottom with the source of information or knowledge. There's a lot of information that all of us pick up, and only what I find interesting goes to the next step. If I'm interested in something, that topic is usually stuck in my head, and I try to visual it in different ways to try and understand it theoretically better. If for some reason, I find it more interesting, it reaches the next stage which is where I try experimenting with the topic in the real world. I then apply it to a real project, teach the concept to someone and discuss it. Based on the discussions, I then repeat the experiments again, trying to prove or disprove the points raised. It feels like a life-long iterative process, but that's how I feel about our general understanding of anything as a species anyway.

As an example to help explain this better, I bring up my fascination with lenses. Even as recent as last semester, I worked on a [project with lenses](http://blog.mithru.com/convex-lens-usb-camera/).  Since a young age, I've always been interested in lenses and wanted to build telescopes and microscopes. I first read about it in primary school and was intrigued. Unfortunately, the system at the time was a lot about the theory and the only thing that everyone worried about was the grade you got in the written exam. All of us knew how to draw ray diagrams and place the object and image on the diagram correctly, but no one knew what this "image" really meant. Only later did I realize that that entire chapter could have been explained with nothing but a box and a cheap magnifying lens. So eventually I experimented on my own, I built (bad but functional) telescopes, microscopes for my cousin who was studying tiny fractures in teeth, and some other fun experiments. My interest level was affected by a bunch of things along the way. The first experiments were done over a summer break when I didn't have to worry about school homework (which involved memorizing text only for the exam). Some of the projects were either done to fulfill a need, like in the case with my cousin for her research, or the telescope which was done for a class at ITP. 

The image below indicates what affects my interest level, and what blocks my learning process.
