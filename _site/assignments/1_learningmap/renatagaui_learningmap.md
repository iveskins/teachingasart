# learning map

here you'll find a guiding map to the way i think i learn. it's composed by 04 parts that correlate to each other. i don't have a prefered order to do them and they normally alternate between each other. mostly i need to experience enough of each of those parts to switch to another one.

### but mostly, all of the possible combinations of the parts have the final goal to make me loose fear & gain confidence to get knowlege over something - and be able to experiment, fail and feel motivated to continue exploring it.

i've always been a bit scared of starting something new & letting go old habits. and i started noticing this once i decided to build a career within the realms of art. i takes me a long time to take ownership of whatever i'm learning and making. i took a long time to call whatever i was doing art; working with sound, a matter that i'm so instigated by, was a big challenge at first because i felt i didn't know enough to pull it off. if i don't feel like i know 100% of what i did, i don't feel comfortable nor confident about the work. that explains a lot why i hate using after effects plugins and coding libraries. and i think that little by little i'm learning to critically analyse what, in the overall picture, matters.

being exposed to brief introductions | experimenting | understanding the basics | getting comfortable with the content
-------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------
being exposed to projects or readings that talk about the topic; talking with friends, colleagues and professors that are exploring it | testing with materials, prototyping, learning from practice and gaining experience | understand from zero the logic of what i'm doing and slowly (but gradually) progress | looking for online content/support regarding this topic, looking through forums and documentation, getting knowleged regarding specific topics
