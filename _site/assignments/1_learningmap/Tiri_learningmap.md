My Learning (how do I learn something?)

I learn when I really focus on that thing. So how I focus on that? it means when I am in the present. This is how I do a meditation too. I was influenced by its practice of a deep critical realization of our spontaneous reaction to all surroundings. You donâ€™t need to be just in the quiet place to do meditation but have self-awareness and know what you are doing now. During the class, If the instructors say the method clearly, I can learn very well too, Also one more thing that helps me to learn a lot is when I fail, The mistake made me know what I am bad and what I should pay attention more. 

The discussion during the class keep me concentrate, Also it gives me a space to think about what I am doing now. Am I lost? what is that for? those questions keep me back on track.
