Conversation is an essential component to the way that I learn.  Without conversation the growth of my curiosity and motivation are stunted.  I believe that it is the responsibility for the expert, or *teacher*, to provide the tools, language, and motivation to encourage learning.   If the tool is the material being taught, then language is the method for questioning and the vehicle to develop curiosity and individual exploration.  From a young age I realized that for me, regardless of how interesting the material (or tool) was,  if I did not have the words to articulate my curiosity or confusion, I would be lost at how to engage further and would quickly lose interest in the subject matter. Simultaneously, an overview of the material’s applications should be presented to inspire by contextualizing the material within its larger system.  Without context, the tools being taught often feel like an end in themselves and not the means for greater exploration.  For instance, if you are only taught that the sine function is a trigonometric function that can be used to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, you will probably find that you will rarely need to find the hypotenuse of any triangle and quickly lose interest.   When I learn, I need to be presented the system and all its components.  I need to know the multitudes of how a tool can be used.  I need to know that the sine function is used in combination with other functions, that it is a necessary formula for the architecture of a building, that the sine curve is used to describe oscillating sound waves, and that with it I can calculate the length of my shadow on a sunny day etc.  

There is a feedback mechanism with in my system of learning.  After applying and practicing/playing with the material presented to me, I need constructive dialogue to move forward and continue engagement.  Without constructive criticism, I will lose interest.  I need a platform to jump from in order to go higher.  I need to hear what I did well and what I did poorly.  Most importantly in conversation, I need to hear how I can improve.  Regardless of whether I succeed or whether I fail, I learn.  However, without continued conversation my system dissolves, my curiosity lessens, a my understanding suffers.

As for the material itself,  I am a hands on visual learner.  Simply sophisticated diagrams go a long way and real world labs make an impression.  You can’t just tell me that gravity works equally on all objects.  I need to see a tennis ball and egg drop at the same time from the same height, and smash and hit the ground at the same time.  I need my hands in the material.  Give me an egg and I will throw it to see what happens.

I also think that it is import to recognize how I receive information, and how one becomes an *expert*.  I like to think of the rhizomic model proposed by Deleuze and Guattari when I think how I understand what I know.    In order to understand, we siphon information from experts, peers, and outside sources.  Our knowledge grows when we intersect and have conversations with these individuals.  It is important to stress that the titles of expert, student, peer, and other are interchangeable.   No matter how removed a subject maybe, it will influence our approach and understanding during any conversation.
