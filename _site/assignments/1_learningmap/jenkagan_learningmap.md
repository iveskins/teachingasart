# learning map

the diagram at the bottom illustrates a few ways i learn. as i started sketching these situations, i found that they roughly break down into two categories:
- relational, and
- information & practice

information & practice could probably be broken down further into "consuming information in the form of words" and "experimenting with materials"

i find that i'm not very interested in exploring materials for the sake of exploring. i usually start exploring materials from a place of having an unmet need, and i am only interested in the materials to the extent that they can come together in a way that meets the need. this feels very utilitarian to me and is why i've never really identified as an artist. sometimes, i joke that i lack imagination—not in the eichmann way, but in the artist way. 

on the other hand, in the sense that sometimes the need is a kind of community or a kind of thinking and not just a piece of software or a bed, maybe this more abstract utilitarianism is imaginative after all. ideas are world-building material just like wood.

i find my relationships with my friends and with my partner to be sites of some of the best learning. this learning is based on feedback, trust, humor, and the shared understanding that we will not dispose of each other—that we are learning together and from each other in order to be in each other's lives longer. this is a place where learning feels most worthwhile to me. 

as i reflect, i also notice that a not-insignificant amount of learning at itp has happened within a context of software projects being a means to building a friendship with someone or some people. not everyone chooses projects on that basis and that's fine, but it's a method that motivates me.
