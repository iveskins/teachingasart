**Feedback for Orizuru and You**

I think Mathura’s workshop was a bit of a success; I sat with her and worked on cranes with fellow Tisch Students in the Riese lounge and with some luck children of the age group she desired to present it to on the stairs of the Met. With the Tisch students it was a little stilted? No one seemed interested in making them, or was too busy. On the other hand, the children were much more enthused about it, and we had quite the group!

She sat with me many times going over, and I am not sure this about her skill as a teacher in question, but perhaps my ability to retain the information? I still cannot for the life of me fold a crane if you asked me, but I don’t believe that was the point? She has been the most patient and understanding person, and even encouraged me as I got overwhelmed and frustrated over not being able to retain it and just do it. But she explained it is also something that is just learned by constant practice, and the crane isn’t the end all but the catalyst by which conversation could be made. Which was easier for me (considering how much I have hard time talking to strangers)!

That I didn’t mind. Talking to children 20+ years younger than me as opposed to similar aged people was interesting, and was more engaged in the activity than the adults seemed. They also were more interested with playing with them than writing on them. With quick thinking, in order to get the children’s cranes ( as they were very much proud of themselves and wanted to keep them) she ‘traded’ with them, meaning they even got to take one home for themselves, which I thought was very sweet and perhaps could be added to the workshop. (One boy really was enthused and asked if we would be there all day at the museum—while we couldn’t; she gave him paper for him to continue on his own).

My only feedback would be perhaps having other options than just the orizuru? Frogs or boats or something a little simpler for people who might find it frustrated, so they have the satisfaction of completing the folding and have the conversation, without feeling like they are failing and break of engagement? Other than that I had a fantastic time doing and could see something like this being a children’s workshop at the Met.
