## Updated Workshop

Since last week, I looked at simplifying the workshop a bit.

Instead of multiple parts, the workshop focused on just making cranes. It was still a walk-in style where one could walk in and learn how to make a crane either with printed instructions or could learn from another person on the table.

Below is the pamplet and the [print out instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orizuru#Folding_the_orizuru).

I tried 2 small sessions of this workshop. One in the Tisch Lounge -

and one on the stairs at the Metropolitan museum of art.

## Kar's workshop

### Overview

Karly had mapped out a wonderful workshop at the Met. The workshop was about paintings depicting women made by women artists. Before we started the workshop, she gave me a brochure which had the history behind the paintings and the artists. I found this really helpful as I usually like to go in to a class/workshop with some context. The brochure was concise and had all the important information required.
The actual workshop itself was around 2 hours. She had also already mapped out the locations of the paintings, so we had our route mapped out. Her extensive knowledge on the paintings was something she was constantly ready to share, irrespective of whether the painting was a part of the workshop or not.
With her extensive knowledge, I do wish we could have seen more paintings.

### About the paintings

We looked at various paintings by Adelaide Labille-Guiard, Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt (whose work I was able to identify by myself at the end). The one painting that we couldn't see but was in the brochure was the painting by Artemisia Gentileschi was a painting that spoke to me strongly. It is a painting that talks about a woman standing up for herself in a time when that was frowned upon. Similarly, Labille-Guiards self-potrait with 2 pupils has a empowering point. At a time when the Royal Academy was a place for men, she went there and painting this painting almost as a propoganda to accept more women into the academy.
These paintings are some of the few which show the true meaning of art - an expression of emotions/feelings. Gentileschi was stuck in an era where she was being treated unfairly because she was a woman and she channeled her anger and frustration through a painting. Similarly, Labille-Guiard conveyed her strong feminist emotions via a painting. I have always considered art an escape from reality and a place to relax. To see people use art in a way completely oppsite to what I am used to was  simply  fascinating.

### Project - A day in the life

*This is an activity suggested by Kar. Students assume the role of a painter themselves living in their time. With this in mind, students will write a diary entry/ newspaper article or review of the piece*

*Disclaimer: forgive my lack of knowledge on the 17th century*

**Name - Adelaide**
**Year - 1985**

Today, I hope to finish the few last touches to my self potrait. While it has been a long and difficult journey, I can see all the effort paying off. While the royal academy allows a maximum of four women members, that is not enough. I will make a hue and cry till they remove that limit, but that is not enough. I want to make a statement, something that will leave a mark on people's minds. Tomorrow when I show this painting to the world, I want them to realise the strength and talent women have. My students and I have overcome many adversities to be here and I will only fight more to make all our dreams a reality.
