Dominic workshop was a very experiential, hands on educational experience. He was able to decrypt for me an artist that works with complex themes and an assortment of media techniques to bring her work to action. If I had stumbled upon the exhibition that was at the heart of the workshop, AK Burns’s ’Shabby but Thriving’ I would’ve definitely not understood the richness that the exhibit encompasses. 

We walked from ITP to the New Museum, the site that hosts Burns’s exhibit. As we made our way there, Dominic introduced me to the figure of AK Burns, who she was, what have been her interests and pursuits (queer-feminism as a central component to it), and the environment that has surrounded her since she started her career. 

Then we arrived at the museum and took the elevator to the 5th floor. There Dominic let me explore the exhibit by myself, but made himself available in case I had questions (which I did). The exhibit has a physical installation component to it, with bags of dirt and still hand sculptures emerging from the walls holding rods, among other elements, as well as a video piece composed of different scenes in a shabby building, where an assortment of humans  explore their relationship to their environment. 

After this , Dominic led me to the Resource Center where he encouraged me to take a look at the books and records that the artist herself curated for the space. He also handed me a zine that was lying beside the elevators that contained an essay on the installation as well as various snapshots from Burn’s moldboard. This was my favorite part, as I was able to combine the sensory, personal interpretation I had elaborated moments ago with context carefully chosen by Burns herself to expand on her concept. 

Overall, I enjoyed the workshop, as it enhanced a visit to a museum that may otherwise have been confusing for me, and left me thinking on the themes that the artist explored in her work.

# Dom's Evaluation of 'Perspectives on Feminism in Latin America'

### What did you thing was the most valuable piece of knowledge that you obtained from “Perspectives of Feminism in Latin America: Mexico as a Case Study?”
- That the "Idol and Saint" and female betrayal concepts are so part of the Mexican identity that they can be easily found in different media from many different time periods.

### In a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ‘completely agree’ and 1 means ‘completely disagree’ how would you rate the following items: 

- The objective of the course was clearly stated - 5
- The instructor was knowledgable of the subject - 5
- The course materials (slides) complemented the oral delivery - 4
- The course was intellectually stimulating - 5
- The instructor answered questions - 5
- The discussion after the lecture enriched the lecture - 5

### What would you wish you had learned about in the lecture that was not mentioned?
- I'm curious about how the "Idol and Saint" concept has changed or been challenged over time. And if there are similarities or differences with historical feminist issues in other countries, (ie, how unique is this in context of other countries)

### How would you improve this lecture?
- I really enjoyed it, so really just have it longer and more content. It is a more traditional type of classroom environment, so I was wondering if there was a way to mix it up. But I'm also not sure about going really experimental with it, either. The information is so great, if you decide to change the formula or venue just make sure that the information stays the center point of what you are doing.
