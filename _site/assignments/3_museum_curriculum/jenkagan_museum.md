i visited the jewish museum, which is located on the upper east side.

the museum has four floors of exhibits. i stuck to the permanent collection, which is called 'culture and continuity: the jewish journey' and consists primarily of ritual objects. there are menorahs, torah covers, shabbat candle holders, and paintings from all over the world. best enjoyed while closing your ears and eyes to the nationalist and assimilationist propaganda everywhere.

in the basement, there's an outpost of russ & daughters, an ashkenazi jewish deli that specializes in smoked fish.

##the workshop—background
in 2014, judith butler was supposed to speak at the museum about her work on kafka. it's possible that the talk would have been related to the lecture she gave about kafka [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234npiDz-SE). i'm interested in bringing butler, kafka, and all of their jewish complications into the jewish museum since they couldn't appear themselves.

##workshop—schedule
- names, intros, why you're here, what's your relationship to the jewish museum

- discuss background: jens hoffmann, the museum's then-deputy director invited butler, a jewish literary scholar and professor, to speak about kafka. there was backlash because butler supports the palestinian-led movement that calls for boycott, divestment, and sanctions on israel until the country ends its military occupation of gaza and the west bank. butler cancelled the talk due to the backlash.

- discuss the content of 'who owns kafka?' lecture (see link above): the story of his papers which were supposed to be destroyed but weren't and were badly stored by descendants of max brod until the national library of israel sued for possession on the grounds that kafka's work is a "jewish cultural asset"; discussion of interested parties and motives; discussion of the fact that kafka, though born in prague, is widely considered a german writer and was skeptical of zionism.

- breakout groups: what defines a "jewish cultural asset"? when does this defintion matter? who is it used by and to what ends?

- share out from breakout groups

- close discussion by sharing the conclusion of lawsuit: the national library of israel did get the writings in the end

- a reading of kafka's story 'jackals and arabs', written in 1917 and published in a zionist magazine

- bye, thanks for coming!
