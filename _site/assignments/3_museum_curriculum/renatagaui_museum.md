#In between the – dashes : personal narratives for a night 

A creative writting workshop proposal for The Morgan Library's current exhibition "I'm nobody! Who are you?"

## The Morgan Library visit

For the class assingment I decided to go to The Morgan Library. 

> It's a "[...] complex of buildings in the heart of New York City, The Morgan Library & Museum began as the private library of financier Pierpont Morgan (1837–1913), one of the preeminent collectors and cultural benefactors in the United States.[...]The mission of The Morgan Library & Museum is to preserve, build, study, present, and interpret a collection of extraordinary quality, in order to stimulate enjoyment, excite the imagination, advance learning, and nurture creativity.[...]The Morgan Library & Museum celebrates creativity and the imagination, with the conviction that meaningful engagement with literature, music, history, and art enriches lives, opens minds, and deepens understanding."

In other words, they are a cultural center that maintains and puts the Morgan's family library as permanent exhibition, have temporary exhibitions regarding art & literature and have a cinema, a cafe and a few concerts during the year. I've seen a few exhibitons there including Beatrice Potter's illustrations & Cy Twombly's Treatise On the Veil creative process. Although the general audience of this museum is senior, they are trying to get a younger audience with exhibits of more contemporary artists and educational programs. I did some research and I found out that schools can schedule specific educational programs / field trips. They also offered free guided tours of the museum's exhibition, lectures and concerts related to what is being exhibit. This past Saturday, I was able to attend one of the guided tours for "I'm nobody! Who are you?", a temporary exhibition about Emily Dickinson work & life. I learned from a friend that all the guided tours are given by volunteers.

## Who was Emily Dickinson if she was nobody

The tour was very informative. Our guide was an eldery short red-hair lady, who would explain each art of the exhibition as she chronologically talked about Dikcinson's life and word as they blended. She had a paper with her, so as we went through different areas of the exhibition, she'd consult the paper to review the content and tell a interesting details about the writter's life.

For me the most interesting aspect of the tour / the content of the exhibiton was how personal the narrative was. The guide was always saying how Emily felt about the world and her work, telling us how her work choices were made etc. This, in my opinion, reflects the fact that Emily Dickinson wanted to be a "nobody". According to the content that I was exposed, she didn't want to be a published author because she believed that the editing work done by publishers were more like a bucher's work and therefore the published writting was too far from the original piece. 

According to the tour, Emily Dickinson had a specific way of dealing with her poem's visual composition. The would write sideways, overlayer writtings and mostly she'd work with dashes within her poem. The dashes, according to the guide, could have many meanings - could be a breathing pause, a pause for a thought, a word play etc.

## In between the – dashes : personal narratives for a night

### About the overnight workshop
Having in mind that the personal narrative of Emily Dickinson was the ruler of this exhibition, this workshop invites the audience to spend the night in the museum on a creative writting workshop. Like the long nights that Emily would be writing in her room(with candle lights on her 18 inches desk), guests are invited to explore how dashes can be used in their own poems. The idea is that, being exposed to that storytelling experience that was the guided tour, people get inspired to write poetry about their personal perspective on death and loneliness (frequent topics on Emily Dickinson's work) & are motivated to repurposed the dash and create their own artistic work. At the end, workshop atendees will share the work produced and have it exposed as an extension of the exhibition.
