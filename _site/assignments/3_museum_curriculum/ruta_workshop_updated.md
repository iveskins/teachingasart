I had to simplify my workshop to make it more executable.

Goal of the workshop: inspired by Raymond Pettibon's work to create a collaborative drawing.

Here's the updated schedule:
  1. **Introduction to Artist's work: 10-15min**
      - Short presentation of who Raymond Pettibon is
      - His work examples
      - Video: [RHCP song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOgFHMEJMeY) and [MOCA interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg6TmR3v5rc).
      
      
  2.  **Exercises to get more creative and ready for drawing: 15min** (see exercises descriptions below)
    - A2B2C
    
    A2B2C is an improv technique, where first person says a word (any word) and the next person says whatever that words made her think of. For example: *first person:* "Apple" (A), *second person:* "Apple makes me think of grass (B) and grass makes me think of summer (C)". Then the next person would use "summer" as a base word.
    - Connect the dots
    
    Printed sheet of paper with text on it. First person puts a dot on random word, second person finds another word that relates to her personally and puts a dot on it as well as connects those dots. It continues so for another 5min.
    - Draw from random words
    
    Three piles of paper sheets: one has nouns on it, another adjectives, and the last one verbs. Pick one from each and draw it. For example: fat window smiling.
    
  3. **Collaboratie drawing: 15min**
  
  Drawing is done in A2B2C technique, where one person starts drawing something and second person continues based on what memories drawn object instigates in him/her.
  4. **Reflection: 5min**
 
    - How do you feel?
    - Do you feel more creative than at the beginning of the workshop?
    - Do you feel like I covered all your "4 must" to learn?
    - Do you want to add anything else?
  
 Materials used: black and red ink, paper, brushes.
