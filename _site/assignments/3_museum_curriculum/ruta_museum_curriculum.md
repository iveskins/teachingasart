I went to visit New Museum -- mainly because I’ve never been and always wanted to.
I didn’t check the program before going and was lucky enough to go just a couple of days after a new exhibition by Raymond Pettibon opened (about that a bit later).

I like an idea of museums as places for exploration, curiosity and invention. I don’t use a word “school” intentionally because for me it has its own baggage and set expectations and sometimes not very positive ones.

Museum’s educational program can be divided into few parts:

1. Activities around current exhibitions: discussions, conversations, listening sessions around related topics. See current [Spring 2017 R&D season](http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/body) around BODY.
    
2. Longer-term initiatives around schools and teen visitors:

      - Lessons plans that museum makes available to schools, seminars for educators (meetings with artists, curators, etc.), school partnerships, teacher memberships
      - Teen Apprentice Program, Experimental Study Program, Teen Nights organized solely by teens, Youth Passes that allow teenagers to access museum for free
      - See full descriptions [here](http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/education).
    
3.  [Resource Center](http://www.newmuseum.org/resources): space where museum visitors can access archival documents, artworks among other materials
    
4.  Family friendly Saturdays and Sundays: every first Saturday and Sunday of the month museum organizes family friendly workshops that seek to engage museum visitors with the current exhibits
    
I really liked one of the family oriented events organized back in 2015 that invited families to explore a variety of questions focused on the city and life. “If streets could talk, what stories would they share?” -- says information on museum’s website. Using this and similar questions, families could build their own [mini-museum](http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/1151/first-saturdays-for-families-talking-streets-1).
    
#**Exhibition**
Exhibition that inspired my workshop curriculum was the one I already mentioned above. Raymond Pettibon: A Pen of All Work is a major exhibition focusing on artist’s work throughout the past 30 years. Artist is famous for chronicling the history, mythology and culture of America with his very distinct drawings and writing that usually provoke complex emotional states.

All of his pieces show both his personal and universal perspectives on our shared cultural experience.

This exhibition reminded me of another one I saw back in Lithuania in 2014 by Romanian artist [Dan Perjovschi](http://www.rupert.lt/en/past-exhibtions/lia-perjovschi-knowlede-museum-kit-dan-perjovschi-time-specific/). Dan Perjovschi is famous to transform museum space into a databank of actuality reflecting what is going on in the world at the moment exhibition is taking place.

To me at times like now, there is no art that is not political. Dan Perjovschi’s exhibition was taking place when Russia was occupying Crimea, so all the messages artist was sending were so timely and sensitive.

Going back to Raymond Pettibon… in the middle of his exhibition there was one space that held the works by people who were inspired by artist’s work and wanted to contribute their own reflections by drawing on the gallery walls.

This open space is a key inspiration for my own workshop…

#**Workshop**

**Give Your Voice** is a two hour (pop up) workshop that brings together museum visitors to reflect on current political and cultural events. Inspired by Raymond Pettibon’s work workshop is an open space to express your support, protest, grief, commitment, and (add your own) to the values that we as society celebrate or (dis)approve.

**How the workshop will work?**

Participants will be given a brief talk about artist’s work, his drawing techniques and then given an opportunity to make their own drawing / write a statement onto gallery’s walls, which will later serve as part of the exhibition.

**Curriculum**

Workshop duration: 2 hours.

Prerequisites: participant must have visited Raymond Pettibon’s exhibition beforehand and has his/her own opinion / feeling about what is currently happening in the world.

Attendance is limited to 15 people at a time.

Registration available **here**.

The workshop time is split accordingly:

  - 20min introduction to artist’s work
  
  - 20min introduction to drawing techniques
  
  - 1h20min of open time for people to discuss and make their drawings / writings

Videos of current events (e.g. speeches, interviews) would be played as prompts in the background to get people’s inspiration going.

Materials (paint, brushes and markers) will be supplied by the museum.

*The goal would be to hold a workshop every week, so that more people could express their voices.*

**Why this workshop?**

Seeing works like this (I was also there when Dan Perjovschi was preparing his exhibition) I always have an “itch” to take a brush and write / paint on the wall myself. I also feel that pen and paper are such powerful tools to express ideas and send messages.
Letting people contribute and seeing a collective story would be a meaningful way to amplify voices.
