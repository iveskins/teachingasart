I visited the Brooklyn Museum, and inpired by the fact that from October last year all the way to 2018 this institution is hosting a series
of events and exhibitions under the theme 'A Year of Yes: Reimagining Feminism', I chose to design a little lecture on the state of Feminism in Latin America,
with Mexico as a Case Study
