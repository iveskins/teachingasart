# Learning objective: 
Students will learn a number of different subjects–to understand their past,present and future, the phenomena of physical of world that surrounds them and how the society and community which they belong to functions– with the Adjacent Possible notion as an underlying structure. This means that throughout the school year, they will be encouraged by their instructors to find connections in seemingly odd places so that they can secure their knowledge beyond mechanical memorizing. Ideally, this will translate in multidisciplinary, tangible projects created by the students to solve problems inside the school and/ or their community. 

The courses will comply with those demanded by the Department of Education, but they will all be taught with a multidisciplinary approach in which all instructors will work as a team and have weekly meetings to discuss how they incorporate the material given by their peers into their classrooms. 

The experience of the student will be tailored so that the instructor corps will identify each’s students strengths and weaknesses in learning. Once they have done so, they will have students work with other classmates in-class recap-sessions as ‘coaches’ or ‘teaching assistants’, but here’s the catch: they will be leading the sessions in which they think they are not good at, always guided by the instructor so that they can understand the material before teaching it and so that the session can be a success.  Instructors must make sure all students get to be at least once a ‘coach’/‘teaching assistant’.


# Learning outcome: 
By the end of the school year, students will be able to identify connections between the knowledge they acquired (even those pieces of knowledge they at first thought had nothing in common). Students will feel more confident in areas they at first thought daunting and will develop a sense of community with their peers in the classroom as a result of the in-classroom review sessions.
