I went to the same private school for all my primary and secondary education, since I was 6 until I was 16. I definitely had a great time. It was a very typical school in terms of the classes we took and 10th grade, being the previous year before leaving for university, had it particularities as well. We had a lot of English classes and in lower amount, French. We had to sing the anthem of Peru every Monday, but once in a while we also had to sing The Marseillaise (I didn’t quite get why). 10th grade was a year on many extra curricular activities (we even made our first real company to participate in a national contests most private schools get involved in Lima). That year my favorite classes where Gramática (Grammar), Teatro (Theatre) and Social Studies. I hated Physics. We started being bombarded by invitations from universities to join them, so it’s the first time we actually had to ask ourselves “Seriously, what am I gonna do for my life?”. Being 15 and asking yourself that question, seems way to much responsibility to deal with. If you add to that the fact that your social life stats getting more real, we are still going to quinceañeros and we are having our first Pre Prom Party. It was not supposed to be a religious school but it was. Even though we only had one hour of Religion classes at school, I will always remember how I was chosen to go to a Radio Show with a group of friends to talk about sex. We had to go with our Religion teacher to supervise us. Definitely everything I said was not what I believed in.

I went to my school’s webpage to see what information they posted about High School and I took what I think are the most important words:

*Creative talent*

*Entrepreneurship*

*Interest in investigating, thinking and applying the knowledge acquired*

*Positive attitude*

*Practice of social values*

*Respect for the environment*

*“We prepare our students so they can accomplish international certifications, taking into consideration the specific needs and individual differences from students in our country with the curricular aspect of developed countries”*

And I think they do. Based on my experience and everything I’ve seen from different schools since then, I designed this curriculum for a 10th grade student in Lima, Peru. Normally it’s not the student decision to join certain school, but the parents. However, I decided to write this in the form of a letter for a student that’s about to start the school year and who I want to get excited about the upcoming year.


**Dear student,**

**We are really excited to have you on board for this year! Our teachers are really excited to meet you and start enjoying an amazing year of experiences. 10th grade may sound like a difficult year, but we believe is also a year of amazing explorations. We’ve had rewritten the entire curriculum for you based on what we think will help you learn, experience and relate. We know it’s a difficult time but we firmly believe that it’s the perfect moment to explore and try different things, to break the mental models you may have build through many years and to think outside the box more than ever. This is our PHILOSOPHY, to give students all the tools and knowledge we can provide for them to experiment. We believe learning in an interconnected process and that creating curiosity is one of our main goals as an institution. This curriculum has also been designed to be explored in a more practical way. Classes will work with other classes and several interdisciplinary projects will come out of them. You will still take all the classes mentioned above, even if you show preference for only some of them. However, trust us, we will make sure you relate to them in a way.**

They also have experience in projects outside school, and will be happy to share them with you. Our LEARNING OBJECTIVE is to put you in touch with a variety of knowledge, to focus on developing critical thinking, to create curiosity in different topics and learn through experimentation. We will also encourage you to work with collective creativity, together with your classmates. With this, you will be able to make a proper decision over your career options.**

**In other words, you will be fully prepared on on the topics addressed on the list of classes you will be taking. You will be able to relate topics and create interdisciplinary projects, as well as working with experienced professionals on the field. You will developed critical thinking, an important contact with art studies, technical skills such as computer science, and be ready to get into the competitive professional environment.

**Here, teachers and students learn together in the highest standard qualities. It will be a challenge, but one you will really enjoy, and one that will prepare you to succeed outside.**
