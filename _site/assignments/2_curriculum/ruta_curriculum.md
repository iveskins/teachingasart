I think it’s good to begin by giving a quick rundown of how Lithuanian education system worked when I was back in high school (it is very similar now as well but I am not that familiar with every peculiarity of it – after all, it’s been more than 10 years ago).
The structure of the education system could be broken down like this:

  •	Primary education: first 4 years, age level 6 to 11
  
  •	Lower Secondary education, the next 6 years (5-10 grades), age level 10-17
  
  •	Secondary education (high school): last two years (11-12 grades), age level 16-19
  
If the school was of Gymnasium status it would last 4 years and would include last 2 years of lower secondary education and would continue throughout secondary education. I went to the same school for all 12 years, so I had all in one.

**Sophomore year would count as the last year at the lower secondary school or 10th grade.**

Subjects that I had to study in the 10th grade were: mathematics, Lithuanian language & literature, English, Russian, History, Geography, Biology, Chemistry, Music, Arts, Religion & Ethics, Physical Education and Crafts.

At the end of the year students would take few tests (normally mathematics and language & literature) to acquire Certificate of Lower Secondary education. This certificate would grant students a right to continue studying in high school.
This year would also be a defining one when students have to choose which module they want to continue studying for the next two years: humanitarian: languages & literature, history, arts or more scientific: math, biology, chemistry and other. These are usually chosen depending on which universities and disciplines students are planning to apply to after graduation.

**Basically, 10th grade is the year where students are pushed to make decisions that would influence the rest of their lives. Since it is so, the curriculum that I would design would be heavily focused on introducing students to the life outside of school through collaborative work and critical thinking and preparing them for the next 2 years until graduation.**

*What is written below by no means mean that it should be valid only during sophomore year, I believe that it should be implemented in every grade starting from the primary education.*

###**Learning objective**

To help students get ready and make an easier decision on which academia path to follow during the last two years in high school as well as after graduating.
To introduce them to the life after school through a multidisciplinary approach.

###**Learning outcome**

Students will gain critical skills necessary in the out-of-the-school world. They will gain confidence and clear idea of which path they want to follow for the next two years in high school as well as after graduating. They will have clear understanding on how each of the subjects studied in school influence real events in the world, as well as how each of them are connected.

*Access to mentors*, *critical thinking* and *experimentation* would be key essentials celebrated throughout the year.

###**Project based education**

There would no longer be separate subjects. Instead of listening to lectures, students would be assigned specific projects on which they would have to work in small groups within given amount of time. In this case students would be project planners, researchers and executors.
Teachers would be encouraged to work together to come up with project themes that included several different subjects (for example, history and math).
At the beginning of each semester students would have to choose 2-4 projects that they want to participate in depending on in the syllabus listed skills.
The goal of it would be to study events and phenomena in the interdisciplinary format.

###**Homework**

All projects would be very heavy on homework. Each students would have individual homework assignments depending on the project they are working on and on the timeline that they created for themselves. To say so, students would make their own rules of time management and tools they want to use (including technology).
Every week students would self-reflect on the progress they made and if any changes are necessary.
At the end of each project students would be required to give a presentation about the process and demo the project.

###**Well designed learning facilities**
With the project based education current classroom setups would no longer work either. Each classroom would have to be set up as a workshop space, where student tables were in the center (of a size that the entire project team could sit together) and teachers could shuffle around.

###**Teachers as mentors and experience designers**

Having project based education, teachers would shift from knowledge owners to experience designers. They would be a curators of student learning process, but by no means a conductors.
As I mentioned above, access to mentors would be really important. That’s why in addition to every project curator (teacher for each project), each student would be assigned a personal mentor – teacher that oversees student’s overall well-being at school and is there to help students explore big questions that they might have. Mentors could change depending on student preference and the relationship they have.
Each project curator would be responsible to bring outside people to give guest talks and introduce students to the outside-of-school perspectives.
