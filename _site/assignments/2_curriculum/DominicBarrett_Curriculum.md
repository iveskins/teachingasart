**Teaching Philosophy**

Facilitating understanding in a subject to younger students involves cultivating interest in that subject. “Why do I need to know this?” is the perpetual teenage question. While “Learning the Basics” is always necessary to a full understanding of a topic, drawing links earlier rather than later in the learning of a topic allow for the opportunity to cultivate more interest and provide multiple contexts through which a student can learn any one subject. 

This teaching philosophy believes that breadth of knowledge does not come at the expense of depth of knowledge. 

**Learning Objective**

In general, this philosophy believes that a radically multidisciplinary approach can involve complete comprehension of any one discipline while simultaneously:

Encouraging the drawing of parallels between topics
Strengthening ability to form metaphor as method of understanding and retention
Impresses the interconnected nature of traditionally discrete knowledge domains

**Learning Outcome**

Students will be able to write, present, and discuss the fundamental concepts of individual topics and their relation to the thematically linked topics (usually paired in a class, but more importantly just in general). At the end of the year, students will be presented with a selection of future courses to take. Students will be expected to communicate (written and verbal) which courses and extracurricular courses they wish to take and why, explanation of why current options are currently lacking, and potential justifications for independent study, testing out of a subject, and/or proposals for new courses or topics of study.

**Outcome Objective** (An extended learning objective)

Students are to be able to articulate educational, career, and life desires. They will be able to analyze, advocate for, and plan their interests and life goals. This can be viewed as something as practical as college prep: students will have the ability to choose schools, majors, classes, teachers, and extracurriculars on the college level. However, more importantly students will have an agency with responsibility. Students will be able to professionally and personally communicate with teachers and faculty that are older than they are.

Faculty share in the responsibility. Teachers and faculty will be able to communicate professionally and personally with students in regards to the academic development of the student, engage in dialog about student’s broader academic goals, propose paths towards those goals, effectively relate practical limitations, idea around limitations, provide resources where appropriate, and advocate for student aspirations where feasible.

This is not just a personal meta-learning, but also learning the nature of academic structure, organizational culture, and community understanding and participation.
