# Teaching as Art final – Weaving as a celebration of strong females

## Pre Workshop
We hosted our workshop this saturday, at my place – because it is a house inhabited by women, we felt we needed a cosier atmosphere and therefore wanted to leave ITP for once. We tried planning the workshop a bit and email / message people with a bit of a distance in time so that people could confirm and come. We did it, talked with people from and outside ITP but in the end, while we were expecting 10-15 people, it was for the best that we had 05 attendees. All women & friends from us. We got the yarns fro the soft lab, bought the rest of the materials for the workshop and laser cut small weaving looms. We also got some snacks. 


## The Workshop

As attendees came, we were doing small talk about life and then once everybody was in we started the workshop. The fact that most of us knew each other made everybody feel instantly comfortable but also the environment easily went casual and a few times we had to bring it back to a workshop state. We started asking everybody to introduce themselves by saying their names and telling a thing they did with their hands (either crafts or building work) that after they were done, they felt empowered. Then, we gave an introduction of how craftwork can be empowering and we talked about our own work. Once we had done that, we talked about how we would teach them weaving by making each of us reflect over an important female in our lives. We gave a piece of paper and a pencil to each of the attendees and we asked them to think about one strong woman in their lives and write about them. After everybody was done, we asked for everybody to read and we talked about what was the role or the roles that these women had in our lives and how they inspired us. Having them in our minds, we started teaching how to weave. We taught basic weaving techniques and then the rest of the workshop was all of us doing the weaving as we talked. We suggested the attendees to mail it to the females they were inspired by, giving them tags in which they could write a note for them.

## Feedback and Reflections

After we were done with the workshop we got feedback from the attendees. They really liked they spend time learning how to weave, because they felt that if there wasn’t a workshop they wouldn’t try to learn by themselves. A few were wondering how we could make the weaving time a bit more dynamic, because they were a bit bored once they got in a specific pattern of how to weave. When we asked about how much inspired they weaving piece was on the female they wrote about, most of them said that they were mostly focusing on doing the weaving - rather than doing the weaving as they think/get inspired by a female. 

In the overall, the workshop was a great bonding time between friends but we wonder how it would be if we have more people, if we had male attendees and it there was people we didn’t know. What we believe was the weakest point was that even though we were able to create a link between weaving and women empowerment, it was tricky to make participants to learn and think about their inspiring woman – sofor next time, we will try to make it a longer one, to be able to teach and then help attendees on planning their weaving piece inspired on a woman. The most positive aspect that we were a small group and that knew each other, so it was nice that right away we were comfortable in sharing our stories and it was manageable to help each one when they had issues while weaving. We would love to do this again, to evaluate how it went and how we can improve it for the next version of it.
