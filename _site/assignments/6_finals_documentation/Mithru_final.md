# Patterns and Permutations: a collaborative workshop

**Abstract**  

This workshop was intended to be a casual workshop for adults interested in collaboratively generating visual art work from patterns they contribute. It was meant to be a social event - participants would form groups organically and collaborate to create work.

**Personal Reflections and Feedback** 

More examples of pattern-related art (other than LeWitt) could be included in future iterations of this workshop to inspire participants when they think about patterns. 

A bigger group would have been ideal, but considering there were 4 of us, and I decided to split larger groups into teams of 4 anyway, it did work. 

Being in New York, and having participants who could each write a different language script turned out to generate some really interesting patterns. 

People seemed to really enjoy taking pictures of items to create patterns - the workshop could focus more on using the camera to create patterns.

On the note of taking pictures, maybe the use of participants' bodies could be more emphasized to create patterns (e.g. make triangles with your fingers and take pictures of them)

The workshop could be performed online with participants from around the world. 

I was surprised that people liked the online tool despite it being bare-bones and not styled - they seemed to enjoy the process more, and ignored any faults the tool had.
