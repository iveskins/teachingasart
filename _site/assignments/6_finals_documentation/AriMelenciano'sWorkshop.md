<h3> The Workshop </h3>

After weeks of planning and discussing how i'll go about hosting my empathy workshop, what a moment it was to finally be standing in front of my participants as I hosted it.

I held the Drawing To See: Empathy Workshop at ITP on a Thursday evening. It was held in a room with 6 people, mostly ITP students.

We began by each writing 15 facts about someone we personally know very well, and someone that is pretty different from everyone in the room.

We then created playlists of about 10 songs that best represented the person.

We exchanged our playlists and facts with someone else and then grabbed a large poster sheet of paper and crayons. We spent about an hour creating portraits based on the facts and music we received.

When we finished, we put up our portraits and had a mini art show. Everyone was able to view each other's portraits and read the facts that inspired them.

We wrapped up the workshop with a reflection, discussion and critique. This part of the workshop was one of the most insightful parts for me as it allowed me to learn how others might perceive the activity and how to go about it in the future. I've attached the recording of our discussion on my personal site.

## Comments

My student Ari's empathy workshop demonstrates a smart way of building temporary community and finding connections among strangers. The workshop makes space for different people (who share little in common) to imagine having an intimate relationship with each others loved ones. There's also something poetic about mixing up the description and playlists.
This workshop is created in response to the lack of diversity in certain professional spaces. I like to think homogeneity or lack of representation of minority, is a chance to make it better. Every kind of social acceptance we enjoy today, are the product of our predecessors' struggle and achievement. When everything looks so grim and hopeless, it's more important than ever, to find solidarity and move forward. I think this workshop can be a way of making space, organization and community more inclusive and diverse. I think this workshop brings opportunities of reaching out to those who appear different, or not interested. They may be shy, unaware, or just misinformed. We all carry prejudices and expectations. It's our duty to break them.
I suggested this book on race, politics and representation to Ari.

Also, this talk on Aesthetics of Doing was really good, and some conversations reminded me of Ari's work. abladeofgrass.org/events/aesthetics-of-doing-performing-transform/
