# Painted by numbers: a data visualization workshop for journalists 

Anyone can make a chart. It is as easy as opening any of the programs of the Microsoft Office Suite and tossing our data into it. Or can we? 

We can lie and be deceitful with charts. Sometimes without meaning to do so. Sometimes we don’t get the math right, sometimes we use a visualization that distorts the information. 

Visual information can be perhaps the most effective way to convey a message: hence the responsibility of being truthful with them. 

I designed this workshop for information professionals who are committed to telling the truth when using visual resources. It offers a quick overview of what data visualization is and its advantages as a communication tool, and goes through some case studies in order to reflect upon common mistakes in presenting data (and how to avoid them).

## Syllabus

- Why would you want to include data visualization in your journalism kit?
- Some definitions to get started (data, information, information design, data visualization, infographics)
- Visual representations of information as cognitive artifacts
- Visual representations of information as models of reality
- Practicing data visualization = practicing numeracy
- Facets of numeracy for producers of data (reading, extracting; writing; presenting) 
- Advantages of visual artifacts to other ways of communicating information
- Where to start? Define the message, choose the data, determine scope and scale
- Classification of diagrams
- Common mistakes in data visualizations and how to avoid them. 3 case studies (bubble charts, bar graphs that don’t start with a zero baseline, 3d pie charts)
- Design tips
- Exercise: make a diagram 
- Final questions and discussion

## Documentation of the workshop mock-up

I had no journalists around to test my workshop, so I gave it to my roomie, Isabella (a civil engineer). Numbers are not a problem to her. Yet, I could see how she found the interplay of data, information and the visual display of it interesting from a conceptual standpoint.

## Feedback on the workshop mock-up

I gave Isa a Google Form to fill out, but the most useful feedback that I got from her was on the actual workshop, were she recommended a couple of modifications. 

### Improve titling
When showing my participant one of my final slide titles that read ‘Make it pretty!’, to talk about the importance of aesthetics, she inquired as to the nature of ‘something pretty’ opposed to something being ‘clear and visually pleasant’. So after a brief discussion on how design is not ‘decoration’, I changed the title of said slide. 


### The exercise part: a complete failure in execution, a valuable lesson for future implementations of the workshop

Another useful thing was to realize how nonsensical the information that I had her work with for the exercise was. I chose random facts on cats (which I know she adores)…and paid the hastiness of my curation with her confusion. I asked her to make a visualization of one of three facts that I displayed on screen. She chose the following: 

>Cats are North America’s most popular pets: there are 73 million cats compared to 63 million dogs. Over 30% of households in North America own a cat.

When she started to sketch out ideas, she insisted on how she could only make a diagram of the first statement (total number of cats and dogs), but not of the second (% of households that have a cat, note that there is not a matching piece of information for the dogs), and certainly not both of them together. 

Here’s how she portrayed her observations:

### Positive comments on the form

What did you think was the most valuable piece of knowledge that you obtained from this workshop?

> How to effectively communicate my information. How to be concise and reliable.

What would you wish you had learned about in the workshop that was not mentioned?

> Nothing else, as she covered both theory and case studies/examples and completed with an actual exercise to reinforce the material covered in the mind of the audience.
