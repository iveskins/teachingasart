After the feedback from last class, I decided to change my workshop into something that is more accessible, and the topic I picked is something I have been practicing myself and has positive impact on myself. Which is the natural indigo dye.

# Abstract

The pursuit of perfection steals our joy. We are less patient and tend to overlook the underlying beauty that waits to be discovered. Therefore, rather than busy ourselves in chasing immaculacy, I prefer slowing down my pace and calmly
observing the situation. I believe that this attitude will help me find the true value of the events that I witness.

I found the Japanese philosophy Wabi-Sabi relevant, which is about cherishing and taking good care of things while also embracing their flaws, especially as they age and come closer to their natural form. Traditional indigo dye practices this philosophy, which is famous for its feature of fading differently as it oxidized in air over different periods of time. Although it is normal for garments that dye together to end up not being identical, Indigo-dyeing causes each garment to develop its very own identity while leaving room for further alternations as well.

**Objective:** The workshop will practice the traditional indigo dye process with basic techniques such as Shibori stitch, and let the participants experience the philosophy of Wabi-Sabi by turning ordinary clothes or fabrics into beautiful indigo items.

**Who:** People who are interested in understanding the natural indigo dye process and the philosophy Wabi-Sabi.

**Process:**
- Embracing flaws and introduction to Wabi-Sabi, demonstrate items or practices that are related to Wabi-Sabi (such as Kintsugi and Indigo-dyeing).

- Gather clothes or fabrics for preparation of dyeing, Shibori stitch demonstration.

- Start the dyeing process!

- Wait for your fabrics to dry and witness the beautiful transformation.

**Duration:** The workshop will run up to 2 hours.

**Setting:** The workshop would take place at ITP. I will provide natural indigo dye kit, a couple hangers and a clothes rack, and supplements that will keep our working classroom clean. participants are expected to bring some old clothes or fabrics.

### Feedback questions

  - How was the dyeing process?

  - How do you like the result of your dye?

**Feedback:**

  - Liked the idea of learning Wabi-Sabi through on-hand experience like indigo-dyeing, I assume it would be hard for me to embrace the flaws by just reading text materials but the moment when I get my unorganized but natural dye pattern on my cloth I was pretty clear of what Wabi-Sabi mean to me.

  - It was a fun process and definitely I love the result. I felt I really learn more when the class is an experience than lecture.

  - I was expecting more teaching on the Shibori stitch so that I can get some patterns that I want, but I still like the result since its really the most organic representation.

**Reflection:**

I found that accessible topic really brings people together, and to run the workshop in a form of experience instead of lecture can be more effective sometimes. Maybe in the future if I have chances to teach, I would teach the core through some related activities or experiences, instead of lecturing directly on certain topic.
