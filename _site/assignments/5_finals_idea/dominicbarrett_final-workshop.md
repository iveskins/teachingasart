**What?**

An introduction to Vaporwave music and its place in internet culture. Then, we all make music together.

Learn the basic concepts of making electronic music with your computer by making Vaporwave with me and a bunch of other first timers. Historical musical precedents will be examined as context and inspiration (musique concrete, muzak, plunderphonics, chop n' screw). Basic approaches to computer based composition will be explained (audio vs midi), as will introductory concepts of audio mixing (EQ, effects, VSTs).



**Who?**

People who want to try something new. People who have always been curious about making music but never have. People who love the internet and memes. People who make music, but want to know how to make it on their computer. People who like being silly and making art with their friends.




**Workshop/Hackaton/Jam Details**

Vaporwave is easy to make. Yes, even you. No, I'm not kidding.

Don't believe me? We're going to make an album in one day and release it on Bandcamp.com

Two 1 to 1.5 hour sessions separated by a dinner break. First half will be informational, learning about the music genre Vaporwave and getting acquainted with the tools. Prompts will be given for people to think about during the class break. Upon return, the second half will be about making as much music as possible in the remaining time.



**Why?**

Make a full song in an hour or two? With no prior experience? A ridiculous goal, perhaps. But the over arching exercise is to not be precious with your creations, and give people the simple joy of creating. Even if it is sloppy or rushed, it can be fun. Silliness is encouraged.

In doing a low-stakes "crash course", all participants will be exposed to fundamentals of computer based music making concepts. Without all of the seriousness of normal music, a free form play with these tools is encouraged and a basic familiarity is hopefully instilled in the participants.



**Where?**

Looking into getting some space on the floor to facilitate this.
