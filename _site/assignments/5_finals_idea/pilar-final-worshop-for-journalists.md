# Practical Tech for the Everyday Journalist: A Workshop

Information. 
Information is how we make sense of the world. A human construct to decode reality. 
When we think of information professionals, we usually think of 'The IT guys". Tech crowd. Engineering folks. Computer science wizards.  
Yet, among the ranks of the people who chose the humanities path, 
there is a rather bizarre tribe that also happens to work with information: the journalist. 

When I was in college, I was taught how to work within certain platforms and mediums. However, the real world, I found out later, 
required me not only to know how to do this, but also to build platforms and tools of my own. 

I believe that Journalists and communication professionals can enrich their practice by immersing themselves into the world of computational thinking
code, data, information architecture and web management. This is why I want to design a crash course on either of (or all of) these topics
designed for busy professionals who could at most dedicate 3 hours to an effort like this. I would like to implement this back home, in Gualajara, this summer, 
and cater it to a small group, perhaps 10, journalists per session.
