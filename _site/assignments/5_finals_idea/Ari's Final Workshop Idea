Title:
Drawing to See

Objective:
To allow people to allow theirselves to truly be 
immersed in the life of someone very different from
themselves. This is done as they are given facts
about a person, listen to the music of that
person’s life and spend over an hour creating
a portrait of them - while also thinking of that
person’s life experience (what clothes they might
wear, what they might see outside of their bedroom
window, typical interactions they might have with 
strangers, etc. The participants move from the eyes
of their subject’s portrait, to their feet - symbolizing how
they begin with a perception of the person but end
really immersed in the person’s shoes.


Agenda:
1:00 -1:15pm |  Participants enter the space

1:15 - 1:45 pm | Participants think of a person that they know well, personally, and 
write down progressively more intimate facts about them on 15 different cards.
They then create a sound track on youtube that would best represent
them musically (their favorite songs or music from their hometown).

1:45 - 2:00 pm | Materials are passed out (6” x 2” paper and markers). Subjects of Drawings
 are collected and redistributed to the participants 
so that everyone has a new subject. 

2:00 - 2:30 pm | Participants are prompted to begin drawing their subjects, using the first
5 cards. They begin their drawing from the eyes. They listen to the playlist as this is done.

2:30 - 2:45 pm | Break

2:45 - 3:45 pm | Participants continue drawing.

3:45 - 4:00 pm | Participants hang their work. Participants are encouraged to look at each other’s
work and reflect on their experience with one another.

Alternative Agenda:
1:00 -1:15pm |  Participants enter the space. They are given
instruction in how to participate in the workshop.

1:15 - 1:20 pm | Participants are given a bundle of 15 cards. Each of these cards hold
progressively more intimate facts about a person. On this package of cards is a website
address to a youtube playlist that best aligns with the subject of these cards. Materials are 
also passed out (6” x 2” paper and markers).


1:20 - 2:00 pm | Participants are prompted to begin drawing their subjects, using the first
10 cards. They begin their drawing from the eyes. They listen to the playlist as this is done.  

2:00 - 2:15 pm | Break

2:15 - 3:00 pm | Participants continue drawing.

3:00 - 3:10 pm | Participants hang up their drawing.

3:10 - 3:30 pm | Participants are encouraged to look at each 
other’s work.

3:30 - 4:00 pm | Participants are invited to reunite and reflect 
and discuss their experience within the workshop.
