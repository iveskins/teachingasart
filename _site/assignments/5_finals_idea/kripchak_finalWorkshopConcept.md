Workshop Title: Making "Fun"

Workshop Topic: Game Design Principles

Revised for Feasibility to Conduct Workshop in the next week.

The biggest difference from my initial proposal is that I am aiming for college-age students - basically ITP. They are really the only demographic that I have easy access to. I feel that the structure used in the original write-up will still work. Beginning with an icebreaker, covering what is a game, and focusing the discussion with workbooks all will still hold valid for the new demographic.

The workshop I will put on will be aimed at a max of 10 participants. I would break those down into 2 groups. The gamification topic would be brought up, but I would end the workshop with the group produced game design pitches.

Workshop Purpose: Introduce and teach a structured view of game design, as categorized in Tracy Fullerton's "Game Design Workshop." To help the "non-gamer" understand and appreciate the art form (and challenge) that is good game design. To illustrate how good game design principles can be incorporated into non-game applications.

Workshop Outcome: Participants will be able to look at games (both digital and traditional) and categorize the different formal and dramatic elements of their designs. They will better understand how to successfully "gameify"customer and internal systems.  Participants will also work in groups to produce a unique game pitch that addresses all the game elements.

Target Audience: The course is aimed at professionals aiming to understand games and what makes a great game. This includes any professional with at least several years of experience in their field, as we will often use "working life" related examples. The workshop is designed to be scalable from 5 people to 50 with a single instructor.

Workshop Pitch: Gamification is an increasingly important concept in merchant/customer and business/employee relationships. Grocery store rewards points. Customer engagement apps. Internal education programs. Game design mechanics can be found in each of them - some good, some (very) bad.

This workshop will introduce you to the serious side of creating "fun." We will cover what makes a game, gain hands-on experience working with the formal and dramatic elements of game design, and address ways these principles can be  incorporated into your profession.

Setup: Workbooks, classic no.2 pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, crayons, colored pencils. Each game design element will have its own worksheets afforded to it. We present it this way to help the room get back into the more childlike headspace of "fun" and to make sure it is always at the center of the design work we will learn about and do.

Order of Events:

Start class with a game as an icebreaker. The game will introduce game concepts and also separate groups of people that are already familiar with each-other.

-What is a game? Introduce the dramatic and formal elements and touch on their interplay.

-Dramatic Elements - Introduce these as a picture of a heroes journey up a mountain and then ending with the prize. Blanks will be placed around the picture that we will fill in as we cover the elements.

-Formal Elements: Biggest challenge is that there are 8 of them so I want to address them as an interconnected system. Don't know how.... I want to design a different activity for each but I still need some mechanic to connect them.

-Again, reintroduce the interconnected nature of the dramatic and formal elements.

-Case Studies

-Make a game design pitch addressing the elements of game design at their current table.

-Return to original table/friend groups and work on enhancing an aspect of their profession/company with game design principles.

Working plan and current questions:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-(Get people to sign their name in the workbook before we have them move to a different chair. Have them reconnect with their original chair, or with the person that ended up with their notebook. Maybe have them put on wristbands before they rotate so that they can remember where they were sitting. )

-What was the purpose of the game? Did it work? Was it fun?

-before breakout: go through some examples of good game design in popular games (tetris, mario, angry birds) and in other industries.

-But also present some things as "Ok, can we work in groups to come point out the elements in x, y, z case studies."

-After they work in their groups, they can then return to their original groups/tables and create a design that addresses something in their profession/workplace that can be augmented with gamification.
